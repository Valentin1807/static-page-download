        <p>22 QUALIFICATIONS As a method of raising awareness and providing opportunities for learners to develop their knowledge of green pathways, green technologies and sustainability, colleges can consider: • Pearson’s BTEC Sustainability Skills Level 2 • Pearson’s Apprenticeship Frameworks in Environmental and Land-based Environmental Conservation Level 3 • City &amp; Guilds Environmental Conservation Level 2 and 3. These knowledge-based qualifications form part of the Apprenticeship Framework for Environmental Conservation, Equine and Floristry and the Advanced Apprenticeship Framework for Environmental Conservation, Equine, Forestry and Floristry. They are also ideal for professional development and preparing you for further learning in the land-based sector. • The OCNLR Level 2 Award, Certificate and Diploma in Skills for Professions in Horticulture, Environmental and Animal Care. This has been developed to provide a flexible approach to study, combining vocational units with ones to enhance learning and employability. The vocational units fall into four themes: i) horticulture, which encompasses but is not restricted to an organic approach; ii) environmental conservation; iii) ‘green care’, which adopts a holistic approach to the relationship between outdoor environments and human health and wellbeing; and iv) animal care. The green units include: o	Ethical and Political Issues relating to Land-Based Activities L2 o	Global Warming and Climate Change L2 o	Introduction to Sustainability L2 o	Investigate an Environmental Issue L2 o	Project in Sustainability L2 o	Global Warming and Climate Change L2 o	Exploring Careers in the Green Industries • A T-Level in Agriculture, Environment and Animal Care 26 For adult learners and upskilling only: • BPEC Rainwater Harvesting &amp; Greywater Recycling Systems – the prerequisites for this qualification are a number of years’ experience in a relevant subject area or a formal qualification in plumbing or heating engineering. 4.2.7 Retrofitting THE MARKET Homes and workplaces account for around 78% of carbon emissions in London, and with 80% of the existing building stock likely to still be in place in 2050, it is important to improve the energy performance of these buildings in order to cut costs and carbon. 27 Home retrofitting, involving fabric improvements, renewable energy generation and low carbon heat sources, is essential for making London’s homes greener, warmer and more affordable to live in. For these reasons, there is also a high level of political support across London to achieve deep carbon reductions from home retrofit. Retrofit London is a collaborative programme, led by London’s local authorities, which will achieve mass home retrofitting to achieve an average Energy Performance Certificate Level of B by 2030. It is being led by the London boroughs of Enfield and Waltham Forest, with support from London Councils and the London Housing Directors’ Group (LHDG), a professional network of senior housing officers. The programme is nationally significant, with an estimated cost of &#163;49bn. and will require a collaborative approach from all parts of government and the retrofit sector, including colleges, to ensure success. This relates to over two million homes across London. 28 However, retrofit does not only relate to homes. Across London, a quarter of a million non-domestic buildings need to be retrofitted by 2030. 29 A large proportion of buildings are classified as heritage buildings and would require 205,000 workers alone if they are to be retrofitted by 2050. 30 Skills shortages are a significant issue – nationally we need around 400,000 additional people - and thus it is one of the 12 priorities in Retrofit London’s ‘Housing Implementation Plan’. This creates a significant opportunity for the colleges in Local London, particularly for Waltham Forest and Barnet and Southgate. 26 https://www.cityandguilds.com/tlevels/land-based 27 Greater London Authority, 2023.
