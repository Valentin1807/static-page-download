        <p>24 COLLEGE PROVISION Of the nine colleges, six plan to provide courses related to smart and sustainable infrastructure - Barking &amp; Dagenham, LSEC, Newham, NewVIc, Shooters Hill and Waltham Forest. Shooters Hill is introducing a short Level 2 award in sustainability and green energies for around 100 students this academic year. Waltham Forest is introducing a T-Level on Building Services in September 2023; supported by its smart home. NewVic plans to pilot a new Level 2 course on sustainability from February 2024. The focus of the colleges is primarily on the domestic market, however there is a strong argument that they should also focus on the commercial market, particularly in building services. QUALIFICATIONS Colleges can consider: • The ‘Design, Engineer Construct! The Digital Built Environment’ course – an introduction for 16–19-year-old learners. The DEC Learning Programme 34 projectbased learning allows learners to apply science, technology, engineering and maths. This pathway leads to a range of professional career pathways in industry and academic progression routes. DEC comprises three levels, each with recognised qualifications: o	Foundation Level 1 o	Intermediate Level 2 o	Advanced Level 3, which attracts full UCAS points for university and degree apprenticeships. The qualifications are: o	TQUK Level 1 Certificate in Design, Engineer, Construct! The Digital Built Environment (RQF) o	TQUK Level 2 Certificate in Design, Engineer, Construct! The Digital Built Environment o	TQUK Level 3 Diploma in Design, Engineer, Construct! The Digital Built Environment 4.3	Staff skills and training This section provides a summary of findings from staff engagement and stakeholder consultations, as it pertains to staff skills and staff confidence, and opportunities for training and Continuing Professional Development (CPD) to deliver the green careers pathways. We carried out in-depth engagement through 1:1 meetings, focus groups and an anonymous online survey to identify what staff require to gain the confidence and competence to deliver the new green careers pathways. This involved speaking direct to 43 out of 61 teaching and careers staff identified as being involved with green careers pathways (in seven of the nine colleges 35) as well as a small number of students, and reviewing the results of 23 completed surveys. 4.3.1	Staff confidence and competence When reviewing competencies, our key findings are as follows: • Staff are keen to upskill and many have started already, but capacity is always an issue. • Staff who still work in industry are the most current and are willing to support their colleagues in a ‘train the trainer’ capacity. • Staff in more traditional trades lack the hands-on industry experience but have higher-level maths, English and design skills. • Staff reported a lack of confidence and awareness of the bigger picture, including the climate crisis, sustainability, national policy and legislation, the green agenda, industry needs, the sector’s employment needs, and general health and safety considerations for the new green technologies. • There is a lack of confidence to deliver against the new standards at Level 3 and a lack of experience with green technologies. • There is a lack of confidence, in particular for those pathways that encompass a number of disciplines, such as retrofit, and those that include technology, e.g. smart/sustainable infrastructure. • There are not enough competent and confident staff mainly due to the salaries not being competitive with industry. This is even more challenging where colleges want to recruit staff with current green technologies and design experience, along with a Level 3 competence in maths and English. Some of the colleges have identified solutions, e.g.: o	NewVIc has recruited a diverse team from industry, academia and maths GCSE and A-level teachers to deliver the T-level and the transition programmes. The department lead provides opportunities for training, including staff to staff training and joint planning of the teaching and learning approach for a qualification. o	Shooters Hill have arranged an industry-led EV course at Level 3 or Level 4 (two days of training at a test centre). o	Shooters Hill developed a partnership with a small local business, Coolio Ltd, who designed the learning content and deliver both theory and practical workshop elements. Coolio Ltd spends one day a week delivering the programme to 84 students alongside an additional CPD offer. o	Colleges that have been working with Quantum Group on the installation of new green facilities and equipment have been or will be receiving training and CPD from them (listed in the CPD table), so that they can confidently and competently use the new facilities and deliver qualifications. 34 Through DEC, colleges and learners can access case studies, resources and training. DEC is created by Class Of Your Own, who have partnered with Training Qualifications UK (TQUK) as the Awarding Organisation licensed to deliver official DEC qualifications. 35 We were unable to engage with Barking &amp; Dagenham College and we were only able to speak with one member of staff at Waltham Forest College on the final day of the consultation.</p>
