        <p>26 4.3.2 Continuing Professional Development and training options During the focus groups and meetings, many of the staff members suggested and requested ideas for training to ensure colleges have confident and competent teaching staff. There is a plethora of providers offering Continuing Professional Development (CPD) and training in the industry prerequisites, the technical installation of green technologies and technical design areas such as BIM and CAD. In addition, there is also provision for foundational professional development in general sustainability and climate awareness, industry health and safety considerations, industry awareness, government policy and legislation. Annex 2 includes a table with the top-level recommended training and CPD options to equip staff to deliver the green skills pathways, along with a link to the more comprehensive CPD, training and qualifications spreadsheet. 4.4	Industry engagement A key deliverable from our industry consultation project was to provide an employer perspective on the Partnership’s and each of the colleges’ approach to facilities, curriculum, staff skills and training, and of course, industry engagement. In this section, we cover the latter. We set out what we have gleaned through desktop research but mostly through direct engagement with over 100 industry stakeholders as well as the college staff who play a role in employer engagement. We have used a mix of in-depthinterviews, more general discussions and participation in a number of roundtables and workshops. We have been actively involved in the various roundtables focused on the London Local Skills Improvement Plan (LSIP), both at a Local London and panLondon level, as well as the colleges’ own Employer Advisory Boards. This section sets out our key findings at a Partnership level on: • The current landscape in terms of stakeholder and industry engagement • The Local London market • Industry feedback - challenges • Industry feedback - driving industry engagement 4.4.1 Stakeholder and industry engagement Engagement between industry and education has been developing and growing over the last ten years, with increasing initiatives and collaborations to engage the next generation into industry. This has been in response to the evergrowing skills gap and the overt peril for business succession plans, primarily visible in construction and engineering. Prime contractors and large multi-disciplinary engineering practices have dedicated outreach teams and community managers to create initiatives and opportunities for engagement with the schools and communities in which they work, however this approach is generally hyperlocal. While this creates pockets of best practice, they are quite siloed and do not achieve the reach a regional joined-up approach could have. Local authorities in London support the development of careers and skills hubs in schools and colleges. Careers hubs such as London East Careers Hub support students by showcasing the multiple opportunities to learn from employers about work, employment and the skills that are valued in the workplace. The hubs integrate the Mayor’s Enterprise Advisory Network in signposting the range of opportunities for students from all backgrounds and showcasing the career opportunities and pathways available into industry in the local area, through careers fairs, voluntary and work experience, workplace visits and enterprise schemes. IT HAS BEEN A WONDERFUL JOURNEY COLLABORATING WITH FURTHER EDUCATION TO SUPPORT THE GROWTH IN RENEWABLE TRAINING AND LOCAL GREEN SKILLS SO FAR. MY ENGAGEMENT WITH INDUSTRY STAKEHOLDERS AND ATTENDING LSIP MEETINGS HAS ENABLED A PRODUCTIVE DIALOGUE BETWEEN EDUCATION PROVIDERS AND EMPLOYERS. IT IS IMPORTANT TO SPEAK OPENLY ABOUT THE CHALLENGES WE FACE WITHIN LOCAL ECONOMIES, WHICH IS SUPPORTING NEW ENTRANTS TO THE WORKPLACE WITH HIGHLY PRACTICAL AND TECHNICALLY COMPETENT SKILLSETS. IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT THESE SKILLSETS EVOLVE AT THE SAME PACE AS RENEWABLE TECHNOLOGY ADVANCEMENTS. Maria Gonella, Managing Partner, The Quantum Group “</p>
