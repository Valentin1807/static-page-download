        <h1>Green Academies Summary Report</h1>
        <p>6 2.1	The context As outlined by the most recent IPCC synthesis report published in March 2023, the viability of humanity living within planetary boundaries rests on the actions we take in the next seven years. To keep within the 1.5&#176;C limit, beyond which climate impacts will be exponentially worse, emissions need to be reduced by at least 43% by 2030 compared to 2019 levels, and at least 60% by 2035 2. The UK government has committed to net zero by 2050 under the Climate Change Act. In 2021, the Mayor of London was re-elected with a Net Zero by 2030 commitment, bringing forward his target by 20 years. The Mayor has set out an ambitious mission for the capital to become a net zero carbon, zero-pollution city by 2030 and a zerowaste city by 2050 3. The impact of climate change has become a reality, even in London, as evidenced by more frequent heat waves, flooding and increasing levels of air pollution. However, climate change also presents an opportunity to lower energy bills, create new jobs and improve quality-of-life. The Mayor of London has adopted ‘Accelerated Green’ 4 as the pathway to reach the net zero by 2030 goal, balancing the urgency and ambition with social justice and deliverability. The aim is to double the size of London’s green economy to &#163;100 billion and 0.5 million green jobs by 2030. Achieving these ambitious targets will require coordinated action from the Mayor, local authorities, wider public sector (inc. national government), finance, businesses, education and communities. Some of the key targets under the Accelerated Green pathway include: • A reduction in emissions of 78% by 2030 (22% residual emissions will need to be offset, with further reduction/ elimination tackled shortly after 2030) • 40% reduction in the total heat demand in buildings, requiring &#163;200K+ homes to be retrofitted each year • The installation of 2.2 million heat pumps and 460K connections to heat networks • A 27% reduction in car vehicle km travelled, combined with a significant transport modal shift • Accelerating the transition to electric vehicles combined with a rapid increase in EV charging point infrastructure These targets will support the creation of jobs and skills, in particular in the areas of retrofit and transport, creating opportunities for all to benefit from. Growth scenarios for Local London indicate a projected rise in green jobs to 61,000 to 91,000 by 2030 (under the central and high growth scenarios) and 110,000 to 205,000 by 2050. Three sectors account for almost 8 in 10 of Local London’s total number of green jobs by 2050: Power (38%); Homes and Buildings (24.9%); Low Carbon Transport (14.6%). Power represents the largest growth sector, followed by Homes and Buildings. Areas such as industrial decarbonisation, hydrogen and carbon capture have the highest predicted growth, but are starting from a much smaller base. 2.
