        <p>9 2.2	The project This project is part of a wider bid, with funding allocated under the Department for Education’s Strategic Development Fund (SDF). The SDF provides investment to enable areas across England to: • reshape their teaching and training provision • update their facilities in preparation for the rollout of local skills improvement plans. The Green Academies Partnership – a group of colleges under the Local London Green Jobs and Skills Partnership submitted a collective bid covering the Local London area plus Bromley sub-region, spanning nine boroughs in the north, east and south east of London (Enfield, Waltham Forest, Redbridge, Newham, Barking and Dagenham, Havering, Greenwich, Bromley and Bexley), representing over 2.5 million residents and around 100,000 businesses. Local London is working to achieve inclusive and sustainable growth, and opportunities for all. This project is designed to support disadvantaged communities, who will benefit from the skills priorities identified, focusing on opportunities to address immediate challenges; support a green recovery; and act as a catalyst of change in the local skills delivery system. It will include collaboration with employers through the BusinessLDN led London Local Skills Improvement Plan (LSIP) to identify changing technologies, skills demands, and employment opportunities in the sector and ensure a pipeline of future skilled talent from our local communities with pathways to improved, higher value employment. The aims of the SDF funded project are to: • Build capacity and coordination through focused recruitment of specialist staff and centralised coordination of activities streamlining provision and avoiding duplication of efforts and costs • Design and deliver new skills in key sectors with acute skills needs through the development of new curriculum content and qualifications that respond directly to employers and sectors with acute skills needs • Improve the quality of further education through the development of a common baseline provision and quality assurance GREEN ACADEMIES PARTNERSHIP INDUSTRY CONSULTATION - A SUMMARY REPORT • Stimulate employer demand and investment in skills through working collaboratively on approaches to employer consultation and engagement • Align local skills needs with the strategic focus of the LSIP. The project included both capital investment for a number of the colleges to invest in the delivery of new infrastructure and specialist equipment and/or upgrading of existing facilities, as well as revenue investment for curriculum and content development, staff upskilling/ capacity building and improved, coordinated industry engagement.</p>
