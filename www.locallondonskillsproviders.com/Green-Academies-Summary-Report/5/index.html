        <p>5 CURRICULUM As mentioned above, the consultation has focused on nine career pathways, with the colleges having mostly already decided which pathways they were focusing on prior to the start of our work. The decisions on pathway choices have been primarily driven by alignment with existing curriculum provision - allowing for quick deployment through bolt-on courses, and decisions on capital funding, along with varying levels of insights on market trends, industry needs, understanding of new technologies, and the policy and regulatory landscape. However, the colleges and local communities would benefit from a strategic, coordinated approach to curriculum planning and decision making at a Partnership level to ensure a holistic offer across the Local London region. The current approach has resulted in many colleges focusing on the same pathways, e.g. seven for EV charging and six for photovoltaics, while at the same time leaving noticeable gaps in areas such as retrofit and insulation technologies. STAFF SKILLS AND TRAINING We carried out in-depth engagement with 70% of staff identified as being involved with green career pathways (across seven of the nine colleges), using a combination of 1:1 meetings, focus groups and an anonymous online survey to identify what staff require to gain the confidence and competence to deliver the new green careers pathways. In addition to the well-known challenges around recruitment and retention, we observed that while many of the staff are keen to upskill and may have indeed already started doing so, there are issues around capacity, experience in new green technologies, and a lack of confidence and awareness of the bigger picture around the green agenda and industry’s needs. We also noted stark differences between the different pathways and colleges, with those in EV charging having much higher levels of confidence than those in heat pump technology. Overall 74% of lecturers felt they needed more support to build wider subject knowledge to be able to deliver the necessary qualifications. We have therefore undertaken quite an extensive review of Continuing Professional Development (CPD) and wider training provision, providing a set of recommendations for the colleges and Partnership to take forward. INDUSTRY ENGAGEMENT Industry engagement was a key component of our consultation work and we engaged with over 100 stakeholders through a mix of in-depth-interviews, more general discussions and participation in a number of roundtables and workshops. Engagement between industry and education has been growing over the last ten years, with increasing initiatives and collaborations to engage the next generation into industry. When looking across the colleges in the Partnership, we observed that industry engagement is good but patchy, with larger, more established colleges generally having the dedicated resources to drive industry engagement. While this has created examples of good practice, such as Employer Advisory Boards, civil engineering forums and digital construction programmes, they do not currently achieve the reach and benefits a regional joined-up approach could have. CONCLUSION In conclusion, colleges in Local London and the Partnership as a whole have already made great strides around green skills provision, however it is imperative the momentum continues and more is done to leverage the power of the collective to increase benefits across the region. We have provided a set of recommendations in the report, for consideration at the Partnership level, and have also set out a proposed framework to develop regional centres of excellence. In order for many of these recommendations to be successfully implemented, we believe it is essential for the Partnership to have a centrally resourced hub that has responsibility for industry engagement, future funding opportunities, professional training and development, and communications for the colleges as a collective. SUMMARY OF KEY RECOMMENDATIONS: In total we identified 16 recommendations. The following nine recommendations are fundamental to the success of the Partnership moving forward: • Create a dedicated plan of action to develop the Local London region as a centre of excellence for 2-3 key areas, such as built environment/retrofit, digital green skills or EV charging. • Explore the opportunity to combine the installation of green labs and the greening of the curriculum with the wider decarbonisation of the college estate. • Leverage the Partnership’s green focus and new course provision to identify new sources of funding, to be used for further capital upgrades as well as revenue funding for the central hub and specific joint initiatives. • Coordinate green career pathway delivery across the Partnership, ensuring both a holistic regional provision as well as each college delivering the most appropriate curriculum aligned with local and learner needs, college facilities and staff expertise. • Develop collaborative, crosscollege relationships to create a Partnership wide teaching, training and CPD plan. • Develop a Partnership-level industry engagement and communications strategy (including CIAG), led by a central team that consolidates and further develops region-wide employer relationships and collaborative partnerships. • Put in place a regular, structured review process to future proof the green skills curriculum. • Develop an internal and external communications strategy. • Create a central planner for key industry events and explore the benefits of having a joined-up Partnership presence at some of these.
