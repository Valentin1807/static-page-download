        <p>36 This SDF project provides all colleges within the Partnership with a huge opportunity to drive the green skills agenda within the Local London region and beyond. The SDF has provided the colleges with the funding and broader support to update their facilities in preparation for the roll-out of local skills improvement plans and to start reshaping their teaching and training provision. If implemented, the recommendations proposed will support the Partnership in meeting the stated aims, namely: • Building capacity and coordination through focused recruitment of specialist staff and centralised coordination of activities, streamlining provision and avoiding duplication of efforts and costs. • Designing and delivering new skills in key sectors with acute skills needs through the development of new curriculum content and qualifications that respond directly to employers and sectors with acute skills needs. • Improving the quality of further education through the development of a common baseline provision and quality assurance. • Stimulating employer demand and investment in skills through working collaboratively on approaches to employer consultation and engagement • Aligning local skills needs with t.he strategic focus of the LSIP. To ensure the Partnership is best placed to take full advantage of this significant investment and to really drive forward the spirit of collaboration we have witnessed firsthand over the last 11 weeks as part of our consultation work, we have set out below a proposed timeline and some key next steps. 6. CONCLUSION AND KEY NEXT STEPS Activity / Action By Date Hold a debrief session with all the colleges to share lessons learnt and agree next steps for the Partnership (including the LSIP). 21 April 2023 Respond to the London LSIP consultation (due to start 6 Apr). 21 April 2023 Launch the Partnership website at the CEME event and start to develop a marketing and communications plan. 26 April 2023 Each college to prepare a business engagement strategy to feed into an overall Partnership strategy. 31 May 2023 Identify a pilot for the ‘centre of excellence’ approach and set up the required Steering Group. 30 June 2023 Continue bi-weekly KIT (Keeping-In-Touch) online meetings to share key updates and initiatives. Hold quarterly in-person meetings, rotating between college sites (perhaps combining this with visits to new green lab infrastructure). Ongoing</p>
