        <p>21 GREEN ACADEMIES PARTNERSHIP INDUSTRY CONSULTATION - A SUMMARY REPORT 4.2.6 Restoring and sustaining London’s green spaces THE MARKET The Mayor of London’s overarching goal is for London to be a greener, cleaner and healthier place for all Londoners. The top priority is tackling toxic air, a public health crisis which is linked to over 4,000 premature deaths every year as well as strokes, heart attacks, asthma, dementia and stunted lung function in children. Other related priorities for London, which also support better air quality include: • Making London the first National Park City, with more than 50% green space by 2050. • Protecting and improving London’s outstanding green spaces; increasing the number of trees through projects including the &#163;9 million Greener City Fund. Green Capital grants support strategic green space projects to bring multiple environmental benefits such as river restoration in parks, new habitats for wildlife and improved space for play. • Making new buildings more eco-friendly, including installing more green roofs and walls. In August 2020 London’s first Green Spaces Commission made two key recommendations in its report. • Establishing and resourcing a Centre for Excellence for London’s public parks and green spaces with the pan-London charity, Parks for London. • Establishing a Future Green Space skills programme as part of the wider ambition to develop green skills in London, bringing together providers and employers to respond to current and future requirements. This is being taken forward in part through the Mayor’s Skills Academies programme and the London Green Space Skills hub led by Groundwork London and Parks for London (including Capel Manor College). 24 The Green Spaces Commission’s report also highlighted the topic of natural capital and that London’s public green spaces have a gross asset value of more than &#163;91 billion, providing services valued at &#163;5 billion per year. 25 At a Local London borough level there is an abundance of green and blue space which will require green skills. Examples include the London Borough of Bexley with over 100 parks covering 638 hectares, including the 100-hectare Foots Cray Meadow; Waltham Forest’s jewel - Walthamstow Wetlands in a 211-hectare nature reserve; and Greenwich’s Royal Greenwich Park covering 74 hectares. There are also many developments – large and small - across the Local London boroughs, which include large green and blue spaces. One example is the redevelopment of Thamesmead, London’s biggest regeneration project, which has 240 hectares of parks and green space, 7km of canals, five lakes, 5km of river frontage and 53,000 trees and will need continual investment in maintenance and enhancement. COLLEGE PROVISION Capel Manor College is clearly best placed out of all the Local London colleges to engage in the green spaces pathway and already runs various courses which meet some of London’s ambitions around green spaces. Possible provision to develop further could include training of business employees on topics such as wilding, as is already the case with Peabody staff at Thamesmead. Nevertheless, there is also the opportunity for other colleges in the Partnership, possibly with Capel Manor’s support, to provide teaching provision in urban greening, potentially in areas such as green walls and roofs, as this is becoming increasingly important in urban planning and development. 24 Greater London Authority, 2023.
