        <p>30 4.4.4 Industry feedback - driving industry engagement Our discussions with stakeholders have also highlighted many positive aspects. The following comments and suggestions include ways colleges and the Partnership as a whole can drive or further improve industry engagement: • Ease of engagement – many of the employers expressed a desire to start or expand their engagement with the colleges, provided it is easy to do so. Most organisations want to avoid complex processes and prefer a clear ask from the colleges, with plenty of time to plan for activities. • A hierarchy of engagement – it would be highly beneficial for colleges to create strategic models of engagement for industry partnerships, with a hierarchy of mutual opportunities that companies can commit to, in line with their daily reality, from a light touch representation on an EAB to employing apprentices and arranging secondments. • On-site engagement – industry can play a big part in supporting colleges with the development of a skilled workforce, through the sharing of their industry skills and experience with college students through talks or workshops, and workplace/construction site tours. These help bring to life the real world of work and are invaluable when it comes to inspiring young people. They also help dispel the myth that the AEC industry is an unattractive sector for a career. • Providing mutual benefit – it is important for colleges to communicate the mutual benefits of working with industry, as some businesses do not see the urgency or the benefit for them to spend time and resources attracting the next generation or developing new service lines such as heat pumps over traditional plumbing services. • Collective engagement – working as a Partnership with a one-tomany strategic engagement approach to industry would drive regional efficiencies and deliver better and more opportunities than through individual engagement at the college level. Some manufacturers and building suppliers offered to provide inkind sponsorship for practical workshops, which helps engender mutual loyalty from the employers to the colleges, and the students to the industry brands. • Strategic partnerships – these are strongly encouraged. Staff secondments can plug gaps in current teaching staff levels; industry can be brought into the classroom and the class can be taken into industry. Inspiration and workplace experience is of paramount importance to encourage students to learn, progress and enter industry. • Leveraging destination data – this will help colleges to keep course topics relevant and in line with industry needs/new technologies. Data supports the generation of a workforce with the right skills at the right time, in line with market forces. • Collaboration with industry associations - the associations have also expressed an interest in engaging with the colleges, whether to support their immediate need with upskilling resources (e.g. BRE), or to share industry learning resources, whitepapers and digital courses. Industry data is needed to maintain strategic growth across the region, to provide a continuous pipeline of skilled workforce to industry, and to reach local and sector sustainability targets. Groups such as the Recruitment and Employment Confederation and the Association for Decentralised Energy are willing to keep colleges up to date with local and national labour market figures, new trends and research. THIS EAB [EMPLOYER ADVISORY BOARD] WAS GREAT. IT’S SO POWERFUL TO BRING DIFFERENT BUSINESSES AND THE COLLEGE TOGETHER – LOOKING FORWARD TO THE NEXT SESSION. “</p>
