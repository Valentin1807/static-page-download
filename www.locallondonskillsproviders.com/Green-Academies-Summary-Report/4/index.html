        <h1>Green Academies Summary Report</h1>
        <p>4 The impact of climate change has become a reality, even in London, as evidenced by more frequent heat waves, flooding and increasing levels of air pollution. As outlined by the most recent IPCC synthesis report published in March 2023, the viability of humanity living within planetary boundaries rests on the actions we take in the next seven years. However, climate change also presents an opportunity to lower energy bills, create new jobs and improve quality-of-life. The market for green jobs is growing fast, with growth scenarios for Local London alone indicating a projected rise to 61,000 to 91,000 jobs by 2030. And while there will be sectors and jobs that will be heavily impacted by the transition towards a net zero economy and even disappear altogether, there is expected to be a net increase in the Local London area. This presents a dual opportunity for the further and higher education sector, who will be required not only to provide new entrants to the labour market but also to upskill/reskill those already in work to be able to meet the demand for new green skills. So the focus, ambition and work of the Local London Green Jobs and Skills Partnership will become ever more important and will be critical in enabling Local London to become a centre of excellence for green skills across several key areas, such as retrofit/built environment technologies, digital green skills, electric vehicle charging and green space provision. Crystal Associates was appointed in January 2023 to lead on the industry consultation project, as part of the wider Strategic Development Fund (SDF) bid, supporting nine colleges1 in the Partnership with green skills provision. The main objective of our work has been to ensure the colleges and the Partnership are well placed to provide the skills and tools for local people to access the green jobs of the future. The scope of work has focused on the following career pathways: • Building Information Modelling • Computer Aided Design • Electric Vehicle Charging Installation • Ground source heat pumps • Internal/external insulation technologies • Photovoltaics • Restoring and sustaining London’s Green Spaces • Retrofitting • Smart/sustainable infrastructure Given the timing of the SDF funding, colleges had mostly already settled on their respective pathways. Our consultation work has focused on assessing college facilities, the current and planned curriculum, staff skills and training, and industry engagement. This report is the conclusion of the work we have undertaken and provides a core set of recommendations for the Partnership moving forward. FACILITIES Over the course of January and February the team conducted site visits to all nine colleges, to get an onthe-ground understanding of existing facilities and planned infrastructure upgrades. Due to the timings of the project, a lot of the equipment had yet to be installed when we visited so our assessment has been mainly based on design drawings and floor plans. Four of the colleges received SDF funding for capital works expenditure: Barnet and Southgate, London South East, Newham and Shooters Hill Sixth Form colleges, which has been primarily focused on the refurbishment of existing space to provide dedicated workshops. Eight of the colleges received capital equipment funding, of which six are working with Quantum Group to deliver and install the physical equipment required to deliver the new green skills-oriented curriculum, primarily acquiring new hardware (e.g. 3D printers, laptops), solar panels, heat pumps, EV charging points, demonstration vehicles and software licenses (for computer aided design and building information modelling). Several of the colleges are facing challenges in areas such as space, health and safety implications and the high costs for certain items (in particular software licenses). 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 1 Barking &amp; Dagenham College, Barnet and Southgate College, Capel Manor College, London South East Colleges, New City College, Newham College, Newham Sixth Form College, Shooters Hill Sixth Form College and Waltham Forest College.</p>
