        <p>29 4.4.3 Industry feedback – the challenges As mentioned, we engaged with over 100 industry stakeholders during the course of the project through a mix of in-depth-interviews, general discussions and participation in roundtables and workshops. This gave us a unique insight into the key challenges employers are facing: • There is an obvious growing need for green skills in industry, specifically for the national retrofit programme and in line with the Social Housing Decarbonisation Fund (SHDF) and ECO4 policy, yet in some areas there is a push back on the green skills’ focus as traditional skills are deemed more urgent now. • Findings show there is an immediate need for both traditional retrofit skills such as carpentry, dry-lining and HVAC installers, and new retrofit skills such as assessors, coordinators and designers, as well as the upskilling of trades for installers, insulators and technicians. • Contractors are expecting the workforce to be traditionally skilled, with growing expertise in green technologies, such as heat pumps, photovoltaics and electric vehicle technologies. • Transferable skills are top of identified employability issues and have been cited as equal or more of a priority to green skills. There is a desire for these to be learnt at college, but it also underpins the requirement for meaningful experiences with employers, in line with Gatsby Benchmarks. • SMEs, who have the highest need to recruit a ready-skilled and experienced workforce, often lack the time, resources and funds to support apprenticeships or graduates. • The threat posed by the so called ‘missing middle’ – Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) organisations are experiencing an expanding talent gap between the older generation of workers, in the last decade of their careers, and new entrants into organisations in the form of graduates and apprentices. If there is a lack in student demand for the existing vocations and the development of new skills required by industry, the talent gap will only widen and create more issues for future progress. GREEN ACADEMIES PARTNERSHIP INDUSTRY CONSULTATION - A SUMMARY REPORT BUILDING SITES ARE GOING TO BE LOOKING FOR A FULL M&amp;E/RETROFIT PACKAGE – FROM TRADES WHO HAVE TRADITIONAL PLUMBING AND ELECTRICAL SKILLS, AND CAN INSTALL A SOLAR PV PANEL. “ AS A BUSINESS WE JUST WANT ONE POINT OF CONTACT WITHIN THE COLLEGES RATHER THAN EMAILING LOTS OF PEOPLE WHO JUST DON’T RESPOND. “ WE’RE JUST A SMALL BUSINESS SO IT’S DIFFICULT TO FIND TIME TO SUPPORT THE COLLEGES BUT WILLING TO CHAT AND FIND OUT HOW WE CAN DO THIS – BUT IT NEEDS TO BE EASY. “</p>
