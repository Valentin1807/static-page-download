        <p>19 GREEN ACADEMIES PARTNERSHIP INDUSTRY CONSULTATION - A SUMMARY REPORT COLLEGE PROVISION Of the nine colleges, six plan to provide dedicated courses on heat pumps. Only Barnet &amp; Southgate, Capel Manor and NewVIc colleges do not. In the short-term, Shooters Hill College would like to focus on F-Gas training. Originally the colleges were going to focus on ground source heat pumps, as indicated in the SDF application. However, due to space constraints the main focus will be on teaching air source heat pumps; colleges like LSEC will just touch on ground source and there is potential to use the provision at CEME Innovation Centre in Rainham. The refocus on ASHP makes sense in view of the scale of the skills challenge from a domestic market perspective as identified above. QUALIFICATIONS Colleges can consider providing a Level 2 Introduction to Heat Pumps, which can be included as part of a transition course or other foundational learning before choosing Level 3 progression routes or alternative pathways. As outlined above, Quantum Group has created a Level 2 qualification which is a good introduction to renewable technologies, including heat pumps: Level 2 ‘Sustainable Energy and Renewables Technologies’ course. This qualification covers installation, service, maintenance, commissioning and fault finding. It also covers wider aspects of understanding the climate challenge, energy transition and the commercial skills required for the workplace. Another option is adding bolt-ons and final year specialisms to existing Level 2/3 qualifications in plumbing or conventional heating engineering. Specialist qualifications include: • City &amp; Guilds Level 3 Award in the Installation of Heat Pump Systems (Non-refrigerant circuits) 2399-34 • Level 3 Award in Environmental Technologies 4.2.4 Internal/external insulation technologies THE MARKET On 30 March 2023, the UK Government unveiled the Great British Insulation Scheme, a rebranded ECO+, which aims to upgrade 300,000 of the country’s least energy efficient homes.19 This follows on from the award on 23 March of &#163;1.8 billion through the Social Housing Decarbonisation Fund, Home Upgrade Grant and Public Sector Decarbonisation Scheme to upgrade social homes and public buildings. As part of this, more than 115,000 vulnerable households and off-gas grid homes with an EPC rating of D or below across England are to receive upgrades to improve their energy efficiency. These schemes could support around 20,000 jobs in the construction and home retrofit sectors and thus will require the necessary skills. 20 In London, the Mayor’s Warmer Homes Programme, launched in May 2022, pledged 43 million pounds of funding for low-income households living in low energy efficiency homes. This was to support around 45,000 London homes with grants for insulation for floors, walls and roofs as well as heat pumps, heating system improvements, draught proofing and solar energy. 21 COLLEGE PROVISION Only one of the colleges is planning to offer provision around internal and external insulation technologies at a future stage. Some of the colleges such as Barking &amp; Dagenham and Waltham Forest have provided plastering courses in the past but this provides an issue with space, which is limited in most of the colleges. To support this transition, we have engaged with the Finishes &amp; Interiors Sector (FIS). FIS’s members are made up of fit-out and specialist contractors, manufacturers and distributors involved in the supply and installation of ceilings, steel framing systems, operable walls, partitions, plastering, dry lining and joinery products in every type of building. QUALIFICATIONS Colleges can consider: • Adding bolt-ons to existing tradesbased ‘Multi Skills Construction’ apprenticeships or T-Levels, or as a progression route. • Supporting learners to take additional unit(s) reflecting a range of insulation-related specialisms. The vocational learning options include: • GQA Level 2 NVQ Diploma in Thermal Insulation (Construction) • City &amp; Guilds Level 2 and 3 NVQ Insulation and Building Treatments • NOCN Cskills Awards Level 2 NVQ Diploma in Insulation and Building Treatments (Construction) (various pathways). • Learners upskilling or reskilling can take additional unit(s), available from NOCN, GQA and City &amp; Guilds, including: o	Cavity Wall Insulation o	Solid Floor Insulation o	Under Floor Insulation o	External Wall Insulation Boarder o	External Wall Insulation Finisher 19 Gov.uk, 2023.
