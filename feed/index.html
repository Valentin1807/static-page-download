										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Local Skills Improvement Fund (LSIF) project at Leyton Sixth Form College has brought about significant improvements in digital learning, staff development, and student experience. This case study outlines the key achievements of the project in three major areas: digital staff training, subject-specific student enrichment, and the introduction of a cutting-edge immersive learning environment.</p>



<p>One of the aims of the LSIF project was to strengthen staff digital skills. All staff received structured training in the use of Microsoft Office 365 tools, such as OneDrive, SharePoint and Teams. This training improved staff confidence in using technology to support teaching, communication, and administration. Many teachers reported greater efficiency and improved collaboration across departments, particularly in the use of Teams for lesson planning, communication and student tracking.</p>



<p>In addition to Microsoft training, teachers also engaged with platforms like Teachermatic and Tablet Academy. Teachermatic helped staff generate lesson ideas and resources using AI-powered tools, which saved planning time and allowed for more personalised learning experiences. Through Tablet Academy, staff accessed professional development in using digital tools for blended and remote teaching. These learning platforms encouraged a wider adoption of technology in day-to-day teaching and introduced staff to innovative ways of delivering content.</p>



<p>The LSIF project also supported student development, particularly for IT learners. A group of IT students took part in a bespoke cybersecurity workshop that was added to their study programme. The workshop focused on real-world cyber threats, ethical hacking, and digital safety. Students took part in interactive activities and simulations that helped them apply their classroom learning to practical scenarios. This hands-on experience not only boosted student engagement but also gave them valuable insight into careers in cybersecurity, a growing industry with high demand for skilled workers.</p>



<p>A major investment through LSIF was the acquisition of a mini immersive room system, designed to create virtual, interactive learning environments. This new facility has been a key innovation at the college, supporting teaching and cross-college collaboration. Staff were trained to use the system to run collaborative sessions, simulations, and guest lectures. The immersive room has already been used in a number of successful ways.</p>



<p>One highlight was a virtual visit to the Imaging Department at Whipps Cross Hospital. Applied Science students were able to explore medical imaging equipment and procedures through a fully immersive experience. This offered them an opportunity they might not have had otherwise and helped them understand how their classroom knowledge applies in a real healthcare setting.</p>



<p>The immersive room was also used to host a virtual meeting with Teesside University London, supporting student progression and strengthening links with higher education. Additionally, it allowed for remote access to a Board of Governors meeting, demonstrating the room’s flexibility for both teaching and wider college operations.</p>



<p>Looking ahead, future developments will include a partnership with Waltham Forest College to deliver apprenticeship tasters for Level 1 and 2 students. The immersive room will also be made available across departments for both student learning and remote CPD for staff. These next steps will help ensure that the impact of the LSIF project continues to grow across the college and beyond.</p>

<p>At the University of East London’s Docklands campus, our mission at RDCS is to turn one of London’s most dynamic regeneration zones into a living laboratory for green skills, sustainable industry and community-driven innovation. By forging partnerships with local SMEs, social enterprises and civic bodies, we deliver hands-on training and cutting-edge research that upskills Londoners while decarbonising our built environment.</p>



<p><strong>Spotlight on Sugarcrete: Sweetening the Construction Sector</strong></p>



<p>Sugarcrete first took shape in the heart of London’s Royal Docks, where UEL’s Sustainability Research Institute (SRI) and MArch&nbsp;Architecture programme, alongside Tate&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;Lyle&nbsp;Sugars, Chemical Systems Technologies and Grimshaw&nbsp;Architects, devised a game-changing bio‑composite. By binding sugarcane bagasse (the fibrous residue from the Tate &amp; Lyle factory) with bespoke sand‑mineral formulations, to create a sustainable alternative to concrete. Sugarcrete bricks deliver:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Up to 80–85% lower embodied carbon</strong> than traditional concrete</li>



<li><strong>High-performance thermal insulation</strong>, validated through rigorous Hot‑Box testing</li>



<li><strong>Circular‑economy impact</strong>, diverting agro‑waste into durable, revenue-generating building blocks</li>
</ul>



<p>What began as an experimental slab on the Thames is now rising in classrooms from Karnataka to Valencia’s harbourside and even dazzling design crowds in Milan.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p><em>Hands-On Build Days</em><br>The Sustainable Research Institute has delivered Sugarcrete Build&nbsp;Days, training learners in mixing, moulding and performance‑testing blocks. Under the guidance of UEL researchers, Architecture tutors and industry mentors, participants not only master practical fabricationand quality‑control techniques but also gain insights into circular supply chains and material life cycles.</p>



<p>Through Sugarcrete, we’re not just erecting eco-friendly walls, but also upskilling Londoners to lead the low-carbon transformation of our built environment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Mayor’s Green Skills Academy’s employers survey on skills assessments has now closed with a total of 29 employer responses. This initiative sought to address individual business training needs in the green and digital spaces as well as build a better picture of what provision is needed as a sub-region of London and beyond.  &nbsp;</p>



<p>Throughout the year, the Local London Skills Provider Network (LLSPN) has made significant progress in strengthening employer engagement and addressing green skills needs through a structured, data-driven approach. A new Employer Consultation Framework was developed in collaboration with the LLSPN to enhance consistency in gathering employer insights. The primary focus has been on the Green Skills and Construction sectors, ensuring that industry needs are better understood and reflected in training provision. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The Green Skills Questionnaire was successfully piloted and implemented across various stakeholder networks. With the survey now closed, the findings have provided valuable insights into employer priorities and training gaps.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>To build on this work, the LLSPN has already started contributing to the Association of Colleges (AoC) employer surveys, which offer a broader, more comprehensive view of skills needs across multiple sectors. This collaboration allows us to leverage national insights while ensuring that local and regional skills priorities are represented within a wider strategic framework. It is encouraging that the AoC has recognised the need for such intelligence, and we look forward to further aligning with and supporting this initiative. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Key findings show employers want training on retrofitting and Passivhaus which has been fed pack to partners, with multiple colleges running courses across these areas. Please visit our <a href="https://www.locallondonskillsproviders.com/about-us/green-skills-prospectus/">green prospectus</a> to find out what’s being offered by partners. </p>

<p>Electrical skills are more important than ever, being essential to the successful roll-out of (among other things) clean energy, new housing, ‘smart’ buildings and the electrification of heat, industry and transport.</p>



<p>For ‘green electrical’ technologies there are now well-established Level 3 qualifications, enabling existing electricians to upskill in EV charge-points, energy storage systems and solar PV.</p>



<p>Like everything associated with electricity, the safety of these installations remains a paramount concern for industry, Government and the general public alike. The Electricity at Work Regulations still apply to ‘green’ installations, as does the Building Safety Act. Before attempting to undertake work in these areas, therefore, installers need to be electrically qualified and competent in the first place.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>We are excited to announce that our Level 2 Award and Level 2 Certificate in ‘Fundamental Principles of Renewable Technologies and Sustainable Energy’ have been officially regulated by Ofqual. This important milestone not only validates the high standard of the qualifications but also reflects our commitment to addressing the growing skills gap in the renewable energy sector. Enabling learners with a pathway necessary to industry, designed to equip them with the practical, theoretical and essential employability skills needed, the qualifications support the UK&#8217;s transition to a low-carbon economy, signifying how learners can start their journey into renewables.</p>



<p>As the government works towards its Net Zero targets, the need for skilled professionals who can install, maintain, and manage renewable energy systems has never been more urgent, and this Level 2 course will enable a clear pathway for current young learners to enter the renewables industry.<br></p>



<p><strong>About the Level 2 Qualification:</strong><br>In collaboration with our trusted manufacturer partners, namely Daikin UK, Quantum have developed the Level 2 course to meet the growing demand for new entrants in the renewable energy installer sector. This qualification distinguishes itself due to being a balance of practical, hands-on learning and solid theoretical knowledge, equipping learners with the essential foundations for continued development in the field, along with essential soft skills crucial for employability. </p>



<p>Whether they are looking to enter the workforce, upskill, or move towards more advanced qualifications, this Level 2 is designed to serve as a stepping stone into the renewable energy sector.</p>



<p>To ensure a competent workforce that is capable of meeting industry demands, it is crucial that engineers are taught about renewable energy systems <em>progressively </em>and early on in their courses/ programs of study.<br></p>



<p><strong>Course Content Overview:</strong><br>Both the Level 2 Award and Level 2 Certificate provide learners with a blend of theoretical understanding and practical skills in Air source heat pumps, solar thermal energy systems, and solar photovoltaic (PV) systems, electrical vehicle (EV) charging, battery storage solutions.<br></p>



<p>Mandatory Units:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>Fossil Fuels: This unit explores the history and impact of fossil fuel usage on the environment and its connection to the global push for renewable energy.</li>



<li>Global Warming: This unit delves into the science of climate change and its broader implications for the world.</li>



<li>Net Zero and Climate Action: Learners will explore strategies for achieving carbon neutrality and understanding the role of renewable technologies in mitigating climate change.</li>
</ol>



<p>Optional Units:<br>Learners will be able to choose between different renewable technologies that stand as specialised units covering fundamental principles and system design of the below technologies:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Air Source Heat Pumps</li>



<li>Solar Thermal</li>



<li>Solar PV, EV, Battery Storage Solutions</li>
</ul>



<p>Providing a comprehensive understanding of renewable energy systems, these practical units equip learners with the knowledge and skills needed to design, install, and maintain sustainable technologies, while also developing essential customer interaction skills vital for career progression.<br></p>



<p><strong>Practical Learning Opportunities:</strong></p>



<p>Quantum places a strong emphasis on practical learning. Our experience demonstrates that the most successful strategy for learners is through hands-on experience. Our state-of-the-art training facilities feature custom-built bays and demonstration units where learners can engage directly with the technologies they will be working with in the field. This Level 2 qualification works hand in hand with our facilities, or any practical facilities that have been installed in Net Zero/ Green Construction training centres around the country as well as for the international market, to enable the trajectory to Net Zero by equipping a future-ready competent<br>workforce.<br></p>



<p>This practical approach helps ensure that learners gain the experience and confidence needed to succeed in real-world environments, providing them with a competitive edge as they enter the workforce. In the words of a current Level 2 plumbing student:</p>



<p><em>“I’m a more hands-on person and the ability to be able to work on systems which involve sustainability, new technology, was amazing. I will learn more when I&#8217;m doing something. With the knowledge I&#8217;ve gained from Quantum’s course, I can move into sustainability and renewable sources of technology. Many plumbers nowadays only know the old stuff that isn’t renewable. I get to stand out now.”</em></p>



<p><br><strong>Who Can Take These Qualifications?</strong><br>These qualifications are particularly suited as a ‘bolt on’ to existing full time study programs in the building services sector at further education colleges, as part of additionality and/or enrichment around ‘green’ construction. However, it is also accessible to anyone with an interest in renewable energy, regardless of background or prior experience. Whether you&#8217;re looking to break into the<br>green energy sector, upskill as a professional, or simply develop knowledge in renewable technologies, this course is for you.<br></p>



<p>In summary, these Level 2 qualifications have no prerequisites, making them accessible and suitable for:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Employers and Businesses: Companies who wish to train their teams in renewable energy skills and meet the growing demand for low-carbon solutions. This course offers a flexible, inclusive pathway for anyone who is motivated to be part of the green transition and the renewable energy industry.</li>



<li>Educational Providers: Colleges and training organisations looking to incorporate a green skills curriculum into their programs.</li>



<li>New Entrants to the Sector: Individuals eager to start a career in renewable energy or those wanting to shift to a more sustainable field.</li>



<li>Reskilling Tradespeople: Professionals such as electricians, plumbers, and heating engineers looking to transition into green technologies at a foundational level before advancing into the industry.</li>
</ul>



<p>This course offers a flexible, inclusive pathway for anyone who is motivated to be part of the green transition and the renewable energy industry.</p>



<p><br><strong>Supporting Industry Needs and Future Careers:</strong><br>The UK must rapidly expand its skilled workforce to meet Net Zero targets. By 2050, 150,000 heat pump installers will be needed, along with a growing demand for solar and other renewable energy specialists. With the government aiming for a 78% reduction in carbon emissions by 2037, urgent action is required. The challenge is not just identifying what needs to be done, but how to achieve it.<br></p>



<p>This Level 2 qualification is part of the solution. Unlike short courses that upskill existing tradespeople, it is designed for new entrants, ensuring a steady pipeline of talent at the foundation level. Without attracting and training new workers, the UK will struggle to meet workforce demands.<br></p>



<p>Industry leaders are already calling for action. The Heat Pump Association (HPA) estimates that around 50,000 installers will be needed by 2030, while Daikin UK emphasizes that 80% of UK homeowners must adopt heat pump technology by 2035. Additionally, National Grid estimates that 400,000 new energy sector workers will be required over the next 30 years. With the Future Homes Standard now mandating a 75-80% reduction in carbon emissions for new homes, low-carbon technologies like heat pumps and solar PV are becoming the new industry standard. This qualification is crucial in closing the green skills gap, equipping a new generation of professionals to drive the UK&#8217;s transition to a sustainable future.</p>



<p><br><strong>Strategic Partnership with NOCN Group:</strong><br>Quantum Training’s collaboration with NOCN Group has been instrumental in the development and regulation of these courses. As an internationally respected awarding body, NOCN Group are known for providing industry-recognised qualifications that meet the highest standards. By combining Quantum’s experience in renewable energy with NOCN’s regulatory framework and reputation for the promotion of their green qualifications, Quantum’s offering is both thorough and applicable to the sector.</p>



<p><br>This partnership also highlights our shared vision of addressing the green skills gap in the built environment sector. With the UK’s growing focus on renewable energy, this course is positioned to provide learners with the skills needed to contribute to the transition to a more sustainable and energy-efficient future.<br></p>

<p>On 19<sup>th</sup> March, City Hall hosted a conference around the theme of ‘Creating a Greener London: Business at the Forefront of Inclusive Growth’. Phoebe Winter, Green Skills Project Coordinator, attended on behalf of the Mayor’s Green Skills Academy for Local London.</p>



<p>The event united leaders in the built environment, clean energy, and green spaces industries to discuss how changes in business practice could lead the way in the green transition.</p>



<p>One of the most interesting points of discussion was the importance of a ‘people first’ approach towards retrofitting. Imandeep Kaur, Co-Founder and Director at CIVIC SQUARE, suggested that the national efforts need to start at the level of neighbourhood involvement in order to create a sustainable green economy. This would involve retrofit initiatives being influenced by those in the communities in which they are taking place.</p>

<p>Colin Timmins, Director of Homes at National Energy Action, continued this theme, by highlighting that retrofit should be thought of as something happening to people, not just to their homes. Many experience anxiety surrounding changes to their homes, which should be further acknowledged when trying to encourage eco-conscious home improvements.</p>



<p>Imandeep and Colin’s ideas created the overall sense that a greater focus on people could help combat reluctance towards retrofitting their homes. Retrofit would stop being something which happens <em>to </em>their <em>house</em>, alienating the inhabitant, and instead becomes a collaboration between the inhabitant, retrofit team, and their <em>homes.</em></p>



<p>It was great to see Phillip Graham, Executive Director for Good Growth at the Greater London Authority (GLA), mention the work of the Mayor’s Green Skills Academies in training Londoners in these skills. It was also fascinating to hear about all the other GLA-funded projects which work towards improving the environment and expanding job opportunities.</p>
