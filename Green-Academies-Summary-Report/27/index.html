        <h1>Green Academies Summary Report</h1>
        <p>27 These initiatives are beneficial, however they do not mitigate the barriers and challenges faced by small to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and Further Education colleges in the engagement and development of skilled young people. The challenges and barriers identified include the perception of the construction/built environment industry as an unattractive sector to work in for younger generations, a general lack of awareness of the green agenda and its priorities by consumers, and the slow demand from industry for green skills visa-vis unrealistic targets set by the Social Housing Decarbonisation Fund (SHDF) 37 and Energy Company Obligation (ECO4) policies 38. There is an opportunity to join the dots from government to grassroots to create the incentives, links and pathways that support local industry needs and access to talent, and generate enough student demand to meet the skills needs. Taking a snapshot view across the colleges in the Partnership, we observed that industry engagement is good but patchy. Larger college groups, such as New City College and LSEC, and others such as Newham College and Barking &amp; Dagenham College enjoy good cross-sectoral industry engagement supported by dedicated people, teams and processes, including documented engagement strategies and Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems. For some of the smaller colleges, it came down to staff, such as the Head of Curriculum, to engage with customers, supported by a simple Excel spreadsheet. However, all colleges acknowledge that improvements can be made. Business engagement remains a priority focus for all FE colleges, and is an Ofsted requirement, and all are working to identify new possibilities. Colleges recognise that government and industry’s push for net zero targets and the subsequent development of new green technologies, their installation and maintenance, will need further and deeper commitments from industry to support a co-designed and integrated approach to future skills’ provision, if supply levels are ever going to reach and match demand. This project has included a review of current best practice for industry engagement across the nine colleges and the opportunities on which to build and develop across the Local London region and Partnership. Colleges are willing to share details with each other on the interventions which have the most impact and the areas of greater need. And there is an opportunity to create a collective approach across the Partnership. Examples of best practice include interventions which form a symbiotic relationship between a college and industry, e.g.: • Employer Advisory Boards (EABs) – these are being reinstated by colleges post-pandemic and are in the planning for those that did not have any. EABs comprise of representatives from relevant and specific industry sectors, such as construction, engineering and digital, and are designed to keep the colleges up to date with current industry needs. They provide industry practitioners with the opportunity to develop meaningful relationships with the colleges and a platform for the development of a co-designed approach to deliver the right skills at the right time. Members of the Crystal Associates team are now permanent members of Newham IoT’s Construction and Digital EABs and also participated in LSEC’s latest Construction EAB. • Business organisations – the main business organisations within the Local London boroughs are the local Chambers of Commerce and The Federation of Small Businesses (FSB). Chambers active in the area include the South East London Chamber of Commerce, which covers five boroughs including Bexley, Bromley and Greenwich, and of which LSEC is a Strategic Partner and thus represented on the Board. Newham College is represented on the Newham Chamber of Commerce. LSEC also engages with the FSB as well as pan-London business organisations such as BusinessLDN, which supported the SDF application, and the London Chamber of Commerce (LCCI), with a representative on LCCI’s skills committee. • Civil engineering forums and digital construction programmes - in collaboration with industry, these support vocationally related approaches, helping colleges to keep abreast of varying pathways into industry via employers or workforce representatives who engage with the students. • Fellowship awards schemes and employer membership initiatives – these are loyalty programmes for local and engaged employers. Representatives are invited in to speak with staff and learners, and are incentivised as individuals for their time. • Industry taskforce participation – such as the London Local Skills Improvement Plan (LSIP), the Construction Industry Training Board (CITB) and government policy groups, both at the national and London level. • Careers hubs, fairs, inspiration and open days – bringing together local schools, young people, families and employers. GREEN ACADEMIES PARTNERSHIP INDUSTRY CONSULTATION - A SUMMARY REPORT 37 The Social Housing Decarbonisation Fund – Wave 2 supports the government’s targets to reduce carbon emissions to net zero by 2050 by funding measures such as ground source heating. It aims to deliver warm, energy efficient homes and reduce carbon emissions and fuel bills. 38 The ECO – Energy Company Obligation order (Jul ‘23 – Mar ‘26) places legal obligations on energy suppliers to deliver energy efficiency measures to domestic premises. It focuses on low income, vulnerable and fuel poor consumer groups through the installation of insulation and heating measures. It aims to encourage the installation of renewables and district heating connections, and the upgrading of heating systems.</p>
