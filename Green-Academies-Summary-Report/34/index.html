        <p>34 INDUSTRY ENGAGEMENT • Develop a Partnership-level industry engagement and communications strategy, led by a central team that consolidates and further develops regionwide employer relationships and collaborative partnerships. Consider: o	Developing a menu of easy engagement options for employers and industry stakeholders, including master classes, industry-led teaching, site visits, and product and technology demonstrations and installations o	Creating a Partnership programme of inspirational events and rolling careers information, advice and guidance (CIAG) activities, to bring together employers, staff, students and parents, bolstering engagement and keeping abreast of new technologies and industry developments o	Organising an annual event bringing together all the Employer Advisory Boards (EABs) from across the nine colleges (and other Local London colleges) to foster collaboration. o	Sharing business engagement resources across the Local London colleges to foster collaboration – this will be particularly helpful to colleges who may not have the need or funding for their own full-time resource. • Create a central planner for key industry events and explore the benefits of having a joined-up Partnership presence at some of these. • Implement a process for upstream and downstream sharing of employer engagement information, i.e. from the central hub to individual college teams (where the engagement is hyperlocal) and from the individual college business engagement team to the central hub (where there is an opportunity for wider collaboration across the region). • Consider introducing a central Partnership-wide CRM system, to facilitate the coordination of industry engagement. 5.2	Developing centres of excellence We believe there is a real opportunity for the colleges in the Partnership to collectively develop regional centres of excellence. We have identified three major areas of opportunity that can be explored on the basis of the nine career pathways: • Built environment, with a particular focus on retrofit and associated technologies, such as photovoltaics, heat pumps, insulation technologies and sustainable/smart infrastructure • Digital, with a particular focus on the role of CAD and BIM in supporting green solutions (in particular in the built environment) • EV charging, including design, installation and maintenance (as part of a wider transition towards low carbon transport solutions) Developing centres of excellence will require a collective and long-term vision, supported by a dedicated collaborative framework. We have below identified the key steps involved in this process, along with a draft framework for collaboration. 5.2.1 Key steps The key steps in this process include: • Identifying key stakeholders (inc. employers, industry associations, professional bodies and government agencies). Through the stakeholder engagement work undertaken by Crystal Associates a large number of key stakeholders have already been identified (as outlined in the industry engagement section of this report and the list included in Annex 2) and some have already been introduced directly to the colleges. • Conducting a needs assessment to help inform the development of the career pathway. Through the work undertaken by Crystal Associates, including market analysis, curriculum review, and qualification and training research, the courses and qualifications required for the above career pathways have already been identified and outlined in this report. The colleges will need to consider how to collectively provide a comprehensive curriculum offer rather than purely as individual colleges. • Developing and piloting the career pathway. Based on the plans already in progress at the colleges and the further recommendations provided by Crystal Associates in both the individual and summary reports, the colleges are already well placed to start developing the curriculum required for a specific career pathway. Piloting/testing new courses and programmes at a smaller level to allow for gathering feedback and making adjustments before a full-scale implementation may be beneficial in certain cases. Through the focus groups the Crystal Associates team has undertaken with various colleges, we have already identified some areas for improvement. • Establishing collaborative relationships. A centre of excellence approach will require developing regular and structured engagement between colleges as well as with employers, industry associations and other relevant stakeholders to ensure the curriculum continues to evolve and meet the needs of industry. • Implementing the career pathway on a larger scale. This will require a dedicated implementation plan, including provision for staff training/ upskilling, and promotion and marketing, as already outlined in the recommendations to various colleges. • Monitoring and evaluating the career pathway. By leveraging both the collaborative relationships (internal and external) and collecting direct feedback from learners and teachers, the colleges will be well placed to ensure the pathway continues to be effective and meets the needs of the market.</p>
