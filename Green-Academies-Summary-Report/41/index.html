We would like to thank the senior leadership, strategic project leads and other key members of staff at each of the nine colleges for their cooperation and contributions to this report, as well as the teaching staff and students who took the time to take part in focus groups and 1:1 meetings, or responded to the survey. A special thank you goes out to the core project team, including Liz Lake, Loraine Williams, Penny Walters, and of course Andrew Cox for his leadership in the initial phase. This team has been instrumental in driving the project and facilitating engagement with the colleges in the wider Partnership. Their continued support, patience and responsiveness have been invaluable in bringing everything together and will no doubt continue to provide momentum for the Partnership moving forward.
