        <p>18 QUALIFICATIONS Colleges should consider: • The IMI qualifications: o	IMI Level 3 award in electric hybrid vehicle system, repair and replacement o	IMI Level 2 and 3 diploma in light vehicle maintenance and repair principles • Providing a Level 2 introduction to Electric Vehicle Charging. This can be included as part of a transition course or other foundational learning before choosing Level 3 progression routes or alternative pathways. As mentioned above, Quantum Group has created a Level 2 qualification which is a good introduction to renewable technologies, including EV charging: Level 2 ‘Sustainable Energy and Renewables Technologies’ course. This qualification covers installation, service, maintenance, commissioning and fault finding. It also covers wider aspects of understanding the climate challenge, energy transition and the commercial skills required for the workplace. • Adding bolt-ons and final year specialisms to existing Level 2/3 qualifications in Electrical Apprenticeships and other qualifications. At Level 3, there are prerequisites to be met for electrical installation – these can be achieved by providing the learners with City &amp; Guilds Level 3 18th Edition: Award in the Requirements for Electrical Installation Award. • IMI Level 3 advanced apprenticeship in engineering maintenance (electric/electronic) with electric vehicle specialist pathway • LCL Level 3 Award in the Design Installation and Commissioning of Electrical Energy Storage Systems (Quantum Group can support this) • LCL Level 3 Award in the Installation and Commissioning of Electric Vehicle Charging Equipment in Domestic, Commercial, and Industrial locations (Quantum Group can support this) • City &amp; Guilds 2921-31 Design and installation of domestic and small commercial electric vehicle charging installations. • City &amp; Guilds Level 3 18th Edition: Award in the Requirements for Electrical Installation Award • City &amp; Guilds Level 3 award in electric/hybrid vehicle awareness • OLEV 14-approved workplace charging scheme installer certification • OLEV-approved domestic smart charger grant installer certification • OLEV-approved public charging infrastructure grant installer certification 4.2.3 Heat Pumps THE MARKET The UK Government’s Ten Point Plan for a green industrial revolution published in 2020, set out ambitions to roll out 600,000 heat pumps into homes per year by 2028. 15 One of the measures in the Government’s announcement on 30 March 2023 was for a new &#163;30 million Heat Pump Investment Accelerator designed to leverage &#163;270 million private investment to boost manufacturing and supply of heat pumps in the UK. The Boiler Upgrade Scheme, which offers a &#163;5,000 grant to anyone buying a heat pump, will be extended to 2028. 16 The Mayor of London’s ‘Accelerated Green’ Pathway sets out plans to roll out 2.2 million heat pumps by 2030 in London alone. 17 New build housing, of which there are some 160,000 per annum, will likely be where we see the fastest uptake of heat pumps (both air source (ASHP) and ground source (GSHP) in the short term as developers look to secure solutions before the looming ban on gas boilers in 2025. However, if the UK is to reach the 2028 target of 600,000 heat pumps, then it is the household retrofit market that will need to contribute the majority of the installations. The expectation is that retrofit will be best serviced by air source heat pumps as a direct replacement for the existing gas boiler market. There were a reported 1.7 million gas boilers installed in 2020 and with well over 20 million residential buildings currently still using a gas boiler there are no doubts about the size of the market as well as the skills challenge. However, the UK still lags far behind its European neighbours such as the Nordics, France and Switzerland in terms of the roll-out of heat pumps. Key barriers to adoption in the UK are stated as the perceived cost and issues around the ability to effectively heat the existing stock of domestic and non-domestic buildings without an insulation first approach which underlines the need for skills in this area too. 18 14 Office for Low Emission Vehicles 15 Gov.uk, 2020.
