        <p>35 5.2.2 A framework for collaboration It is essential for all colleges with plans for current/future provision within a specific pathway to contribute to the creation and implementation of a centre of excellence proposition. However, we believe there is benefit in having anchor leadership to ensure: 1) clear direction in the development process, 2) greater focus, efficiency and streamlined decision making and 3) a clear point of contact for external stakeholders. The leadership can either be fixed with one or two colleges taking on a permanent anchor role or it could take a more flexible approach through a form of rotational leadership. The latter would put less pressure on an individual college and allow for the sharing of responsibilities, as well as opportunities to showcase multiple colleges and campuses. Taking a lead role would come with both responsibilities and benefits (for both the lead college(s) and the wider region). Responsibilities include: • Creating a project plan, which sets out the goals, timeline, budget, and deliverables for the development of the centre of excellence. The plan should address curriculum development and delivery, but also wider opportunities for funding, staff training and joint marketing/ promotion. In addition, the plan should also consider channels for regular monitoring and evaluation, e.g. annual surveys. • Undertaking market research, to stay abreast of market trends, new and upcoming government policies and regulation, technological developments, funding opportunities, etc. • Setting up and chairing a Steering Group with representatives from the relevant colleges, which meets on a regular basis and ensures all the colleges involved have an opportunity to contribute, so the needs and priorities of all colleges can be reflected and an effective regional offer can be established. • Establishing and chairing a dedicated Employer Advisory Group (EAG), that brings together key representatives from industry, including employers, associations and training/awarding bodies. The role of the EAG will be to provide guidance and advice on the development of a regional centre of excellence. • Leading regular stakeholder engagement (beyond the EAG) to gather input and feedback on the curriculum, quality of graduates, etc. as well as to develop mutually beneficial opportunities for collaboration and partnerships, e.g. maintenance contracts with the colleges that include staff training and student placements, industry secondees, career support, etc. • Leading on coordination and oversight of curriculum development, ensuring the regional offer is comprehensive, relevant and aligned with industry needs. • Identifying opportunities for collective training and support for college staff, and for optimising/ sharing resources between colleges. Benefits include: • Greater visibility and recognition, allowing the college to position itself as a leader in the field and demonstrating its commitment to providing high-quality training and education in this area. • Enhanced reputation and standing within the industry and among external stakeholders, creating more opportunities for staff and learners. • An overall improved curriculum that is relevant, up-to-date, and aligned with the needs of the industry, resulting in better outcomes and opportunities for learners. • Access to increased funding opportunities from external sources, such as government agencies, including the Greater London Authority, or industry associations. The Partnership could also consider establishing a more formalised structure, e.g. through a joint venture, with a central hub and resources. This hub could be commissioned to lead on work that is strategically important and relevant to all the colleges, e.g. labour market information, workforce assessment, curriculum development, funding applications and lobbying.
