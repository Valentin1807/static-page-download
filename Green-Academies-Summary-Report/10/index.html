        <p>10 The Crystal Associates team was appointed in January 2023 to lead on the industry consultation project, supporting nine colleges 6 in the Partnership with green skills provision. The main objective of this work has been to ensure the colleges and the Partnership are well placed to provide the skills and tools for local people to access the green jobs of the future. The scope of work has focused on the following career pathways, identified by the colleges through previous research and consultation: • Building Information Modelling • Computer Aided Design • Electric Vehicle Charging Installation • Ground source heat pumps • Internal/external insulation technologies • Photovoltaics • Smart/sustainable infrastructure • Restoring and sustaining London’s Green Spaces • Retrofitting Over the course of the project, we have focused on the following four areas, through a combination of desk research, extensive industry and wider stakeholder consultation, and direct engagement with each of the colleges: • Facilities - we have conducted dedicated site visits with each college, including meetings with the strategic leads and other key staff • Curriculum - we have reviewed and assessed both the current curriculum provision as well as planned provision tailored to the new pathways • Staff skills and training - we have undertaken a combination of staff focus groups, 1:1 meetings and an anonymous staff survey, alongside dedicated research and stakeholder engagement to obtain both quantitative and qualitative data on current and future market requirements and training • Industry engagement - we have undertaken extensive industry consultation, speaking to more than 100 organisations (from employers and industry associations to training and awarding bodies), as well as assessing the current levels of engagement at each college. In conclusion of this project, we have provided an overall summary report for the Partnership, alongside dedicated reports for each individual college. In this summary report, we focus on our assessment of and future opportunities for the Partnership and the Local London region as a whole, as it pertains to facilities, curriculum (current and planned), staff skills and training, and industry engagement. We share our findings and set out recommendations on facilities, future skills provision, staff training and collaboration with industry, against the overall objective of positioning the Local London area as a centre of excellence for several green skills pathways, including built environment/retrofit (incorporating key technologies such as digital, electric vehicle charging and green space). 3. OVERVIEW OF OUR METHODOLOGY AND APPROACH 6 Barnet and Southgate College, Barking &amp; Dagenham College, Capel Manor College, London South East Colleges, New City College, Newham College, Newham Sixth Form College, Shooters Hill Sixth Form College and Waltham Forest College.</p>
