        <p>33 GREEN ACADEMIES PARTNERSHIP INDUSTRY CONSULTATION - A SUMMARY REPORT CURRICULUM • Create a dedicated plan of action to develop the Local London region as a centre of excellence for a few key areas: 1) built environment/retrofit 2) digital green skills 3) EV charging 4) green spaces (supported by Capel Manor College). Draw on the framework outlined below and consider the best leadership approach to drive this, either with 1-2 anchor colleges or through a more flexible approach of rotational leadership. • Coordinate green career pathway delivery across the Partnership, ensuring both a holistic regional provision as well as each college delivering the most appropriate curriculum aligned with local and learner needs, college facilities and staff expertise: o	Develop an easily searchable map of the curriculum offer across the Local London region. o	Use ongoing industry engagement/partnerships and employment data to inform, develop and adapt the curriculum. • Embed the new green pathways and new T-Level qualifications by engaging with: o	The Education and Training Foundation (ETF) for T level support, particularly the support around engaging with industry to develop best practices and technical skills. o	The Association of Colleges and their series of FE events and training, from webinars, annual in-person and online conferences and exhibitions to master class series, workshops, leadership and management programmes and in-house training. • Put in place a regular, structured review process to future proof the green skills curriculum. This should take into account industry needs, national and local policy and regulation, climate and sustainability targets, and industry innovation. o	Develop the template and process to enable informed decision making. o	Keep abreast of additional, new industry trends/pathways, e.g. hydrogen, to ensure the career pathways focus of the Partnership remains relevant and up to date. o	For the built environment/ retrofit/construction related curriculum, consider both the skills required for the domestic and non-domestic sector, including commercial and historical buildings. STAFF SKILLS AND TRAINING • Develop collaborative, crosscollege relationships to create a Partnership wide teaching, training and CPD plan. Consider: o	Creating a Partnership-wide record of teaching staff and their specialisms. o	Sharing teaching resources to optimise curriculum provision to students. o	Implementing a train-thetrainer model, whereby staff from one college can train staff from other colleges in their specialism. o	Developing a process and set of resources to attract and support people from industry to teach in colleges, working in partnership with the industry engagement teams. A good avenue for this is through HR as part of the organisation’s CSR, ESG and SDG reporting. o	Creating a central hub of ‘experts’ comprised of industry partners who spend a small amount of time in education and industry lecturers who would be too expensive to employ full-time. This hub of experts could: - Help co-design learning and create new resources - Provide master classes for staff and learners. o	Setting up a ‘College Training and Development’ group to share best practice between colleges. o	Implementing a training and CPD offer with a central coordinator, which would reduce administration and costs, generate higher attendance and facilitate the opportunity for staff from different colleges to interact and learn from each other. o	Working with external specialist providers to supplement the delivery of courses e.g. the BIM Academy, and to provide specialist training and a broader introduction to green technologies and sustainability/ ESG. o	Combining industry site visits – apart from being preferable and easier for employers, it will also reduce administration requirements, such as the need for multiple risk assessments. o	Arranging Partnership college visits for staff and students, for example to Waltham Forest College to learn from the smart home development.</p>
