        <h1>Green Academies Summary Report</h1>
        <p>11 Key findings in each of the four themes of facilities, curriculum, staff skills and training, and industry engagement across the colleges in the Partnership are as follows: 4.1	College facilities Site visits were carried out to ten sites across the nine colleges. These were as follows: • Barking &amp; Dagenham College, Rush Green campus with the East London Institute of Technology • Barnet and Southgate College, Southgate campus • Capel Manor College, Enfield campus • London South East Colleges (LSEC), Bromley Campus • New City College, Hackney campus • Newham College, the London City Institute of Technology and Stratford campus • Newham Sixth Form College • Shooters Hill Sixth Form College • Waltham Forest College, Waltham Forest campus The majority of site visits took place between 27 January and 14 February before a lot of the equipment had started to be installed. Hence our findings are based on what was available to see and design drawings and floor plans. Four of the colleges received SDF funding for capital works expenditure: Barnet and Southgate, LSEC, Newham and Shooters Hill Sixth Form. 7 Eight of the colleges received capital equipment funding and six of them are working with Quantum Group to deliver and install the physical equipment required to deliver the new green skills-oriented curriculum. The following section summarises the facilities at each college which have been identified to provide the respective green skills courses. It also touches on any planned facility upgrades as part of the current SDF funding, and any perceived challenges and opportunities for the future. More details can be found in the individual college reports. 4.1.1	Barking &amp; Dagenham College The green provision will be located in an annex to the East London Institute of Technology (IoT). One of 12 current IoTs in the country it has been designed in partnership with Coventry University London, to deliver advanced and higherlevel specialist training in emerging occupations including construction and infrastructure technologies as well as advanced engineering and robotics, creative, digital and IT. Barking &amp; Dagenham College (BDC) is one of six colleges working with Quantum Group to deliver and install the physical equipment required to deliver the new green skills-oriented curriculum. The BDC project is being overseen by the Head of Department for Building Services and Smart Construction who carried out a similar project at Havering College. At the time of our site visit on 2 February 2023, the room had been prepared but no equipment had been installed. Capital equipment purchased by BDC as part of the SDF project is: smart home technology, a solar system, PV battery storage, four insulation testing rigs and EV testing rigs. During the site visit we were shown where the solar panels are to be installed on an adjoining roof. We were also informed there would be an air source heat pump located outside although it seemed not to have been purchased. 4.
