        <h1>Green Academies Summary Report</h1>
        <p>32 We have below provided a set of key recommendations in the four areas of college facilities, curriculum, staff skills and training, and industry engagement, alongside some general ones, for consideration at the Partnership level. College specific recommendations have been included in the individual reports. In addition, we have also set out a proposed framework to develop regional centres of excellence. In order for many of these recommendations to be successfully implemented, we believe it is essential for the Partnership to have a centrally resourced hub that has responsibility for industry engagement, future funding opportunities, professional training and development, and communications for the colleges as a collective. In addition, the central hub should also support the process to develop centres of excellence. The central hub would be funded by the colleges (or through additional external funding) and would have the people, infrastructure and processes in place to drive forward the strategic planning and collaborative working. Even though there will be costs involved in the setting up, resourcing and running of the hub, the colleges would greatly benefit from the efficiencies and cost savings derived from joined-up strategic planning and collaborative working. 5.1	Recommendations GENERAL • Develop an internal and external communications strategy, which would include: o	The roll-out and management of the Local London Green Jobs and Skills Partnership website and central information hub. o	A monthly newsletter, providing updates on Partnership and college specific initiatives, industry news, new technologies and innovations, case studies and inspiring profiles. • Regularly review and make use of data sets, including destination, market and employment data, to inform all aspects of strategic planning for the Partnership. • Create a central information bank on environmental excellence including best practice examples from different colleges. COLLEGE FACILITIES • Leverage the Partnership’s green focus and new course provision to identify new sources of funding, including through exploring further collaboration with the Councils, Local London and the Greater London Authority. Funding could be used for further capital upgrades as well as revenue funding for the central hub and specific joint initiatives. • Explore the opportunity to combine the installation of green labs and the greening of the curriculum with the wider decarbonisation of each of the college estates. • Where relevant, ensure tenders/ contracts for retrofitting the respective college estate include conditions for contractors to offer work placements, master classes and site tours to students and possibly staff. • Share innovations which are being installed and tested at certain colleges, e.g. the plan to install 300 smart sockets at Newham College’s W Block. • Where feasible, provide space for relevant businesses to engage with the respective college and the students as is being done at Barking &amp; Dagenham College and planned at the London City IoT (Newham College). 5. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE FUTURE OF THE PARTNERSHIP</p>
