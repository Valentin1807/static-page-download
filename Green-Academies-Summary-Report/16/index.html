        <p>16 The qualifications offered by colleges vary depending on the type of college: • Most predominantly offer full-time courses for 16-19 years olds: Level 1, 2 and 3 qualifications and Level 3 apprenticeships in construction and the trades, e.g. bricklaying, carpentry, plumbing, electrical and construction multi skills. All of these subjects and qualifications are useful pathways into green careers in photovoltaics, electric vehicle charging installation, heat pumps, retrofitting and internal/ external insulation technologies. • Level 3 apprenticeships allow learners to specialise in year 4 in a green technology, e.g. a Level 3 qualification in plumbing or conventional heating engineering, with a specialisation in ground source heat pumps. This ensures laying down the foundational learning and industry prerequisites before choosing a green pathway. • Several of the colleges are planning to offer or are already offering the new T-levels. The T-Levels are intended to be an alternative to A-levels, apprenticeships and other courses for 16-19 year olds. They are currently in an early stage of development and the available construction related T-Levels are primarily focussed on new build. However, they offer a good opportunity for the green career pathways, in particular if the work placement is able to offer the relevant experience. Some T-levels, such as the T-Level in Construction Design, Surveying and Planning, give learners the opportunity to develop highly desirable design skills, using tools like CAD. Other construction T-levels, such as T-level Technical Qualification in Onsite Construction, allow learners to develop more of the skills for installing, maintaining and fault finding of green technologies. • Several colleges are offering transition pathways at Level 2, which are a good way to introduce learners to different green pathways. These courses are designed to allow a learner to gain the level of mathematics and English they require and to try the vocational area, before considering whether to progress onto a T-Level, apprenticeship or other Level 2-3 qualification. • A smaller number of colleges offer short or part-time courses for adult learners who want to upskill. This is a very important aspect of the green careers pathways. Examples include upskilling in retrofit via PAS2035-aligned qualifications (for skilled workers in aligned trades, e.g. plastering, rendering) or Level 3 18th Edition: Award in the Requirements for Electrical Installation Award, for Photovoltaics (key for employers). A list of the qualifications offered by the nine colleges is included in Annex 1 of this report. The following section gives further details for each pathway. Our recommendations for career pathways and qualifications across the Partnership are based on: industry needs, Local London needs, recognising which colleges are best suited to deliver specific pathways, reviewing types and levels of qualification and which colleges are best placed to deliver them, coordinating and combining resources and staff training. 4.2.1 Computer Aided Design (CAD) and Building Information Modelling (BIM) Given the connected nature of these two career pathways we have looked at them together in this report. THE MARKET The global computer-aided design (CAD) market was valued at USD 9.89 billion in 2021 and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.9% up to 2030. 9 Key players in the 3D CAD software market that have been mentioned by some of the colleges and employers interviewed include Autodesk, Bentley Systems, Dassault Syst&#232;mes, Siemens, Trimble and TurboCAD. The global building information modelling (BIM) market was valued at USD 5.2 billion in 2019, and is projected to reach almost USD 16 billion by 202710. The generally understood objective of BIM software is to enhance project performance and to produce better outcomes through enhanced data communication and coordination among various stakeholders coupled with improved construction productivity. To this effect, BIM is sometimes also defined as “Better Information Management” and not just at construction stage but across the whole value chain from initial concept design, through to construction, operation, retrofit and even demolition. A key part of this is the concept of digital twins. The global digital twin market size was valued at USD 11.12 billion in 2022 and is projected to exhibit a CAGR of 37.5% from 2023 to 2030. 11 9 Polaris Market Research, 2022.
