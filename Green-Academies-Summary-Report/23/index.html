        <p>23 GREEN ACADEMIES PARTNERSHIP INDUSTRY CONSULTATION - A SUMMARY REPORT COLLEGE PROVISION Of the nine colleges, only New City College is specifically looking to provide courses on retrofit in the near future. The current provision is theory based and the College wants to transition to more practical courses. Barking &amp; Dagenham and Newham colleges are considering such courses in the future. To support this transition, we have been engaging with various industry stakeholders, including the Retrofit Academy, who are able to support with a compelling license agreement to exclusively deliver accredited training, resources, quality assurance and assessment support. QUALIFICATIONS A retrofit career path can be started through a general construction course or apprenticeship (e.g. Level 2 plastering, dry lining, construction skills, and installation operative; Level 3 Plastering, Thermal insulation, Construction Multi-Skills) and then adding on smaller retrofit qualifications or applying directly to an employer and working towards the achievement of specific retrofit qualifications, such as Level 2 and 3 NVQ Insulation and Building Treatments, which is a requirement for installing insulation on retrofit projects. A tradesperson needs to be skilled in one or more of a range of energy efficiency measures to take on one of the main retrofit roles, such as Assessor, Coordinator or Installer. The Retrofit Academy has a long history in the sector and created the first accredited programme. Their retrofit courses and qualifications are: 1.	NOCN Level 2 Retrofit Understanding of Domestic Retrofit - this provides an excellent grounding for anyone in the retrofit sector, but is specifically designed for technicians ahead of their NVQ or apprenticeship, as part of a transition course or T-Level. 2.	NOCN Understanding Repair and Maintenance of Traditional Pre-1919 Buildings (for historic buildings) 3.	AIM Level 3 Award in Domestic Retrofit Advice – this qualification gives learners an appropriate level of technical understanding together with customer service skills. This can also be used in addition to an apprenticeship, as a bolt-on to a T-Level, or before a Level 4 or 5. 4.	AIM Level 4 Award in Domestic Retrofit Assessment – for the assessor role 5.	AIM Level 5 Diploma in Retrofit Coordination and Risk Management – for the coordinator role For colleges offering programmes and apprenticeships in areas such as electrical, plumbing and heating, they can also consider: • Adding a specialist pathway to year 4 of an Apprenticeship in Plumbing or Domestic and Heating Technician, using a bolt-on qualification from a variety of units the NOCN Group offers, covering subjects such as retrofit, solar, insulation and energy efficiency. These are ideal to support existing qualifications, courses and apprenticeships or as part of the FE enrichment programmes. In particular, there is a retrofit unit which is specific to historic buildings: Understanding Repair and Maintenance of Traditional Pre-1919 Buildings - Level 3. 4.2.8 Smart/sustainable infrastructure THE MARKET The term ‘smart and sustainable infrastructure’ is extremely broad and people’s perceptions and understanding of its meaning and impact vary significantly. In a ‘Smart London’ context, London’s Chief Digital Officer has set out six key priorities for the 2021 to 2024 Mayoral term which build on the now completed ‘Smarter London Together’ roadmap. Two of the six priorities refer specifically to “green” including the Emerging Technology Charter and the Sharing Cities project which focus on scaling green tech and open innovation linked to the Green New Deal. 31 The Horizon 2020 ‘Sharing Cities’ project was a major international smart cities project, with London as one of the three lead cities, that addressed some of the most pressing urban challenges facing today’s cities such as energy use, low carbon transport and buildings, and harnessing data for the good of the city. The programme was officially completed in December 2021. The London pilot projects were set in Greenwich and delivered by DG Cities, the digital arm of Greenwich Council. The pilot projects focused specifically on a water-sourced heat network, building energy efficiency measures, electric vehicles as well as digital engagement with local residents, all topics relevant to the Local London Green Jobs and Skills Partnership. Smart buildings normally refer to the use of Internet of Things (IoT) devices (e.g. sensors, software, online connectivity) across various building wide systems (HVAC, lighting, alarms, security) into a single IT managed network infrastructure, in order to maximise the efficiency of building operations and services, and ensure the comfort of its occupants. Smart buildings are seen as a critical component in the race to achieve net zero. The global smart building market was valued at USD 67.60 billion in 2021 and is projected to grow significantly to USD 328.62 billion by 2029. 32 The global smart home market is also expected to grow from USD 99.89 billion in 2021 to USD 380.52 billion in 2028. 33 31 Greater London Authority, 2023.
