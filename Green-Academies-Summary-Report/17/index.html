        <p>17 GREEN ACADEMIES PARTNERSHIP INDUSTRY CONSULTATION - A SUMMARY REPORT COLLEGE PROVISION Of the nine colleges, five will focus on CAD – Barking &amp; Dagenham, LSEC, New City, Newham and NewVIc and three on BIM – LSEC, Newham and NewVIc in the short term. NewVIc is actually supporting Barking &amp; Dagenham College with the delivery of its CAD training. Barnet and Southgate and Waltham Forest colleges are considering CAD and BIM from September 2024, although there could be an opportunity sooner for Barnet and Southgate to leverage its focus on gaming, as some universities such as the University of East London (UEL) are doing. The general feedback has been that the high cost of the CAD licenses from the key market players is generally prohibitive. Licenses are mainly paid for on an annual basis or on a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) model. Capel Manor College is also using CAD as part of the garden design provision but plans to use Trimble’s SketchUp software which is less flexible than some other software but cheaper. QUALIFICATIONS Colleges could consider: • Partnering with MOBIE to deliver the Pearson BTEC Level 3 Extended Diploma in Construction and the Built Environment, which has the existing core units from Pearson and six specialist MOBIE modules designed to give learners foundational knowledge and experience about the future of home building and smart/ sustainable building. The modules cover: o	Building Information Modelling (BIM) o	CAD (Revit) o	Principles of Offsite Construction o	Off-site manufacturing (OSM) Housing Industry and Economics o	Alternative and Renewable Energy Systems o	Digital Technologies The vocational learning options include: • For CAD: o	City &amp; Guilds Computer Aided Design (7689) Level 1 Award in Parametric Modelling and Level 2 Computer Aided Design courses. • For BIM: o	OCN Level 3 Implementation of Building Information Modelling (6073-31) and Level 3 Fundamentals of Building Information Modelling (607330) o	OCN NI Level 3 Award in Digital Construction with Building Information Modelling (BIM). 4.2.2 Electric vehicle charging THE MARKET As part of its announcement on 30 March 2023, the UK Government revealed plans to invest more than &#163;380 million into boosting EV charging points and infrastructure across the country to support the rollout of electric vehicles. 12 This follows on from the setting out of its UK electric vehicle infrastructure strategy in March 2022 and the vision to end the sale of new petrol and diesel vehicles by 2030 and for all new cars and vans to be fully zero emission at the tailpipe by 2035. As part of the Mayor of London’s ‘Accelerated Green’ pathway, there is an ambition to reduce car vehicle km travelled by 27% by 2030 as well as accelerating the shift to EVs and enabling a rapid increase in EV charging point infrastructure. One key barrier to the adoption of electric cars is the number of publicly available rapid chargers. As of November 2021, there were around 8,400 chargers in London – the Mayor of London has committed to a further 1,000 rapid chargers by 2030. 13 In addition to cars, the number of electric black cabs is also increasing as well as electric delivery vans and zero emission buses. The latter require higher voltage charging points. There are examples around the world of the electrification of river freight and HGVs which could also be relevant to London and the UK in the not-toodistant future. COLLEGE PROVISION Seven of the nine colleges plan to provide courses on EV charging. Shooters Hill is also looking at maintenance and fast overhead chargers for larger vehicles such as HGVs and buses. Several of the colleges already have motor vehicle provision, including LSEC, Newham (Stratford campus), Shooters Hill and Waltham Forest. Once the infrastructure has been installed Shooters Hill will also offer short bolt-on courses. EMPLOYERS ARE REALLY LOOKING FOR PEOPLE WITH DEGREE LEVEL QUALIFICATIONS FOR BIM “ 12 Gov.uk, 2023.
