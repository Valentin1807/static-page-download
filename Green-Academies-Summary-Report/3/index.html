        <p>3 With the green industries growing at an exponential rate, never has there been a more important time for employers, educators and local authorities to come together and meet the skills challenges we are all facing. With the race very much on to meet the government’s 2050 net zero targets, every business in every sector is having to consider its carbon footprint and invest in ways to reduce it. Many specialist green jobs are opening up to support this transition – so securing a pipeline of high-quality skills and talent is crucial. We are playing our part here at London South East Colleges by leading the Local London Green Skills and Jobs Partnership – a collaboration of 13 FE colleges, over 30 employers and 11 Local Authorities in the northeast and southeast of London. Supported by the government’s Strategic Development Fund, this partnership is working to respond to the expanding green economy through skills delivery and sustainability. With so many job opportunities emerging, we are committed to working with employers and local authorities to ensure people of all ages can get the training they need to access these exciting careers. A key part of this project has been the evaluation of college facilities and their existing and future green skills provision, including staff training and industry engagement. Crystal Associates have undertaken this work, helping us to define scope and priorities as we plan our collective response to the needs of the green economy. This summary report provides insight into the context, size and scope of the green opportunities awaiting us in the Local London region. Industry experts have shared their views and insights on the future of low carbon skills in key sectors, which is set to dominate the direction of skills for many years to come. This is a time of great opportunity for the region and I am delighted with the progress being made. I would like to thank all our partners for their ongoing support. I look forward to continuing this work together and seeing the positive impact it will undoubtedly have both now and in the future. With kind regards, Dr Sam Parrett CBE, Group Principal and CEO, London &amp; South East Education Group FOREWORD A SUMMARY OF THE FINDINGS FROM THE GREEN ACADEMIES PARTNERSHIP INDUSTRY CONSULTATION (PROVIDED BY CRYSTAL ASSOCIATES, MARCH 2023)</p>
