        <p>3 With the green industries growing at an exponential rate, never has there been a more important time for employers, educators and local authorities to come together and meet the skills challenges we are all facing. With the race very much on to meet the government’s 2050 net zero targets, every business in every sector is having to consider its carbon footprint and invest in ways to reduce it. Many specialist green jobs are opening up to support this transition – so securing a pipeline of high-quality skills and talent is crucial. We are playing our part here at London South East Colleges by leading the Local London Green Skills and Jobs Partnership – a collaboration of 13 FE colleges, over 30 employers and 11 Local Authorities in the northeast and southeast of London. Supported by the government’s Strategic Development Fund, this partnership is working to respond to the expanding green economy through skills delivery and sustainability. With so many job opportunities emerging, we are committed to working with employers and local authorities to ensure people of all ages can get the training they need to access these exciting careers. A key part of this project has been the evaluation of college facilities and their existing and future green skills provision, including staff training and industry engagement. Crystal Associates have undertaken this work, helping us to define scope and priorities as we plan our collective response to the needs of the green economy. This summary report provides insight into the context, size and scope of the green opportunities awaiting us in the Local London region. Industry experts have shared their views and insights on the future of low carbon skills in key sectors, which is set to dominate the direction of skills for many years to come. This is a time of great opportunity for the region and I am delighted with the progress being made. I would like to thank all our partners for their ongoing support. I look forward to continuing this work together and seeing the positive impact it will undoubtedly have both now and in the future. With kind regards, Dr Sam Parrett CBE, Group Principal and CEO, London &amp; South East Education Group FOREWORD A SUMMARY OF THE FINDINGS FROM THE GREEN ACADEMIES PARTNERSHIP INDUSTRY CONSULTATION (PROVIDED BY CRYSTAL ASSOCIATES, MARCH 2023)</p>
        <p>4 The impact of climate change has become a reality, even in London, as evidenced by more frequent heat waves, flooding and increasing levels of air pollution. As outlined by the most recent IPCC synthesis report published in March 2023, the viability of humanity living within planetary boundaries rests on the actions we take in the next seven years. However, climate change also presents an opportunity to lower energy bills, create new jobs and improve quality-of-life. The market for green jobs is growing fast, with growth scenarios for Local London alone indicating a projected rise to 61,000 to 91,000 jobs by 2030. And while there will be sectors and jobs that will be heavily impacted by the transition towards a net zero economy and even disappear altogether, there is expected to be a net increase in the Local London area. This presents a dual opportunity for the further and higher education sector, who will be required not only to provide new entrants to the labour market but also to upskill/reskill those already in work to be able to meet the demand for new green skills. So the focus, ambition and work of the Local London Green Jobs and Skills Partnership will become ever more important and will be critical in enabling Local London to become a centre of excellence for green skills across several key areas, such as retrofit/built environment technologies, digital green skills, electric vehicle charging and green space provision. Crystal Associates was appointed in January 2023 to lead on the industry consultation project, as part of the wider Strategic Development Fund (SDF) bid, supporting nine colleges1 in the Partnership with green skills provision. The main objective of our work has been to ensure the colleges and the Partnership are well placed to provide the skills and tools for local people to access the green jobs of the future. The scope of work has focused on the following career pathways: • Building Information Modelling • Computer Aided Design • Electric Vehicle Charging Installation • Ground source heat pumps • Internal/external insulation technologies • Photovoltaics • Restoring and sustaining London’s Green Spaces • Retrofitting • Smart/sustainable infrastructure Given the timing of the SDF funding, colleges had mostly already settled on their respective pathways. Our consultation work has focused on assessing college facilities, the current and planned curriculum, staff skills and training, and industry engagement. This report is the conclusion of the work we have undertaken and provides a core set of recommendations for the Partnership moving forward. FACILITIES Over the course of January and February the team conducted site visits to all nine colleges, to get an onthe-ground understanding of existing facilities and planned infrastructure upgrades. Due to the timings of the project, a lot of the equipment had yet to be installed when we visited so our assessment has been mainly based on design drawings and floor plans. Four of the colleges received SDF funding for capital works expenditure: Barnet and Southgate, London South East, Newham and Shooters Hill Sixth Form colleges, which has been primarily focused on the refurbishment of existing space to provide dedicated workshops. Eight of the colleges received capital equipment funding, of which six are working with Quantum Group to deliver and install the physical equipment required to deliver the new green skills-oriented curriculum, primarily acquiring new hardware (e.g. 3D printers, laptops), solar panels, heat pumps, EV charging points, demonstration vehicles and software licenses (for computer aided design and building information modelling). Several of the colleges are facing challenges in areas such as space, health and safety implications and the high costs for certain items (in particular software licenses). 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 1 Barking &amp; Dagenham College, Barnet and Southgate College, Capel Manor College, London South East Colleges, New City College, Newham College, Newham Sixth Form College, Shooters Hill Sixth Form College and Waltham Forest College.</p>
        <p>5 CURRICULUM As mentioned above, the consultation has focused on nine career pathways, with the colleges having mostly already decided which pathways they were focusing on prior to the start of our work. The decisions on pathway choices have been primarily driven by alignment with existing curriculum provision - allowing for quick deployment through bolt-on courses, and decisions on capital funding, along with varying levels of insights on market trends, industry needs, understanding of new technologies, and the policy and regulatory landscape. However, the colleges and local communities would benefit from a strategic, coordinated approach to curriculum planning and decision making at a Partnership level to ensure a holistic offer across the Local London region. The current approach has resulted in many colleges focusing on the same pathways, e.g. seven for EV charging and six for photovoltaics, while at the same time leaving noticeable gaps in areas such as retrofit and insulation technologies. STAFF SKILLS AND TRAINING We carried out in-depth engagement with 70% of staff identified as being involved with green career pathways (across seven of the nine colleges), using a combination of 1:1 meetings, focus groups and an anonymous online survey to identify what staff require to gain the confidence and competence to deliver the new green careers pathways. In addition to the well-known challenges around recruitment and retention, we observed that while many of the staff are keen to upskill and may have indeed already started doing so, there are issues around capacity, experience in new green technologies, and a lack of confidence and awareness of the bigger picture around the green agenda and industry’s needs. We also noted stark differences between the different pathways and colleges, with those in EV charging having much higher levels of confidence than those in heat pump technology. Overall 74% of lecturers felt they needed more support to build wider subject knowledge to be able to deliver the necessary qualifications. We have therefore undertaken quite an extensive review of Continuing Professional Development (CPD) and wider training provision, providing a set of recommendations for the colleges and Partnership to take forward. INDUSTRY ENGAGEMENT Industry engagement was a key component of our consultation work and we engaged with over 100 stakeholders through a mix of in-depth-interviews, more general discussions and participation in a number of roundtables and workshops. Engagement between industry and education has been growing over the last ten years, with increasing initiatives and collaborations to engage the next generation into industry. When looking across the colleges in the Partnership, we observed that industry engagement is good but patchy, with larger, more established colleges generally having the dedicated resources to drive industry engagement. While this has created examples of good practice, such as Employer Advisory Boards, civil engineering forums and digital construction programmes, they do not currently achieve the reach and benefits a regional joined-up approach could have. CONCLUSION In conclusion, colleges in Local London and the Partnership as a whole have already made great strides around green skills provision, however it is imperative the momentum continues and more is done to leverage the power of the collective to increase benefits across the region. We have provided a set of recommendations in the report, for consideration at the Partnership level, and have also set out a proposed framework to develop regional centres of excellence. In order for many of these recommendations to be successfully implemented, we believe it is essential for the Partnership to have a centrally resourced hub that has responsibility for industry engagement, future funding opportunities, professional training and development, and communications for the colleges as a collective. SUMMARY OF KEY RECOMMENDATIONS: In total we identified 16 recommendations. The following nine recommendations are fundamental to the success of the Partnership moving forward: • Create a dedicated plan of action to develop the Local London region as a centre of excellence for 2-3 key areas, such as built environment/retrofit, digital green skills or EV charging. • Explore the opportunity to combine the installation of green labs and the greening of the curriculum with the wider decarbonisation of the college estate. • Leverage the Partnership’s green focus and new course provision to identify new sources of funding, to be used for further capital upgrades as well as revenue funding for the central hub and specific joint initiatives. • Coordinate green career pathway delivery across the Partnership, ensuring both a holistic regional provision as well as each college delivering the most appropriate curriculum aligned with local and learner needs, college facilities and staff expertise. • Develop collaborative, crosscollege relationships to create a Partnership wide teaching, training and CPD plan. • Develop a Partnership-level industry engagement and communications strategy (including CIAG), led by a central team that consolidates and further develops region-wide employer relationships and collaborative partnerships. • Put in place a regular, structured review process to future proof the green skills curriculum. • Develop an internal and external communications strategy. • Create a central planner for key industry events and explore the benefits of having a joined-up Partnership presence at some of these. GREEN ACADEMIES PARTNERSHIP INDUSTRY CONSULTATION - A SUMMARY REPORT</p>
        <p>6 2.1	The context As outlined by the most recent IPCC synthesis report published in March 2023, the viability of humanity living within planetary boundaries rests on the actions we take in the next seven years. To keep within the 1.5&#176;C limit, beyond which climate impacts will be exponentially worse, emissions need to be reduced by at least 43% by 2030 compared to 2019 levels, and at least 60% by 2035 2. The UK government has committed to net zero by 2050 under the Climate Change Act. In 2021, the Mayor of London was re-elected with a Net Zero by 2030 commitment, bringing forward his target by 20 years. The Mayor has set out an ambitious mission for the capital to become a net zero carbon, zero-pollution city by 2030 and a zerowaste city by 2050 3. The impact of climate change has become a reality, even in London, as evidenced by more frequent heat waves, flooding and increasing levels of air pollution. However, climate change also presents an opportunity to lower energy bills, create new jobs and improve quality-of-life. The Mayor of London has adopted ‘Accelerated Green’ 4 as the pathway to reach the net zero by 2030 goal, balancing the urgency and ambition with social justice and deliverability. The aim is to double the size of London’s green economy to &#163;100 billion and 0.5 million green jobs by 2030. Achieving these ambitious targets will require coordinated action from the Mayor, local authorities, wider public sector (inc. national government), finance, businesses, education and communities. Some of the key targets under the Accelerated Green pathway include: • A reduction in emissions of 78% by 2030 (22% residual emissions will need to be offset, with further reduction/ elimination tackled shortly after 2030) • 40% reduction in the total heat demand in buildings, requiring &#163;200K+ homes to be retrofitted each year • The installation of 2.2 million heat pumps and 460K connections to heat networks • A 27% reduction in car vehicle km travelled, combined with a significant transport modal shift • Accelerating the transition to electric vehicles combined with a rapid increase in EV charging point infrastructure These targets will support the creation of jobs and skills, in particular in the areas of retrofit and transport, creating opportunities for all to benefit from. Growth scenarios for Local London indicate a projected rise in green jobs to 61,000 to 91,000 by 2030 (under the central and high growth scenarios) and 110,000 to 205,000 by 2050. Three sectors account for almost 8 in 10 of Local London’s total number of green jobs by 2050: Power (38%); Homes and Buildings (24.9%); Low Carbon Transport (14.6%). Power represents the largest growth sector, followed by Homes and Buildings. Areas such as industrial decarbonisation, hydrogen and carbon capture have the highest predicted growth, but are starting from a much smaller base. 2.

        <p>8 In terms of occupational groups, the fastest growth rate is projected for skilled craft workers (113% increase to 2030), projected to be the largest group in 2030. Growth rates for other groups are: associate professionals (63%); managerial (98%); professional (87%). While there will be sectors/jobs that will be heavily impacted by the transition towards a net zero economy and even disappear altogether (in particular in construction and land transport), there is expected to be a net increase of 6,700 jobs in 2030 and around 3,900 jobs in 2050 in the Local London area. 5 Even so, further and higher education will be required not only to provide new entrants to the labour market with the requisite green skills but also to upskill/reskill those already in work to be able to meet the demand for new green skills. As such, there is both an urgent need and an amazing opportunity to: • Increase education provision in subjects and courses that are relevant for green jobs • Increase the proportion of those taking relevant courses who progress to employment within green sectors • Increase the flows from other, nongreen, sectors into green sectors, including through re-skilling training. 5 Edgar, J. et al, 2022.

        <p>9 2.2	The project This project is part of a wider bid, with funding allocated under the Department for Education’s Strategic Development Fund (SDF). The SDF provides investment to enable areas across England to: • reshape their teaching and training provision • update their facilities in preparation for the rollout of local skills improvement plans. The Green Academies Partnership – a group of colleges under the Local London Green Jobs and Skills Partnership submitted a collective bid covering the Local London area plus Bromley sub-region, spanning nine boroughs in the north, east and south east of London (Enfield, Waltham Forest, Redbridge, Newham, Barking and Dagenham, Havering, Greenwich, Bromley and Bexley), representing over 2.5 million residents and around 100,000 businesses. Local London is working to achieve inclusive and sustainable growth, and opportunities for all. This project is designed to support disadvantaged communities, who will benefit from the skills priorities identified, focusing on opportunities to address immediate challenges; support a green recovery; and act as a catalyst of change in the local skills delivery system. It will include collaboration with employers through the BusinessLDN led London Local Skills Improvement Plan (LSIP) to identify changing technologies, skills demands, and employment opportunities in the sector and ensure a pipeline of future skilled talent from our local communities with pathways to improved, higher value employment. The aims of the SDF funded project are to: • Build capacity and coordination through focused recruitment of specialist staff and centralised coordination of activities streamlining provision and avoiding duplication of efforts and costs • Design and deliver new skills in key sectors with acute skills needs through the development of new curriculum content and qualifications that respond directly to employers and sectors with acute skills needs • Improve the quality of further education through the development of a common baseline provision and quality assurance GREEN ACADEMIES PARTNERSHIP INDUSTRY CONSULTATION - A SUMMARY REPORT • Stimulate employer demand and investment in skills through working collaboratively on approaches to employer consultation and engagement • Align local skills needs with the strategic focus of the LSIP. The project included both capital investment for a number of the colleges to invest in the delivery of new infrastructure and specialist equipment and/or upgrading of existing facilities, as well as revenue investment for curriculum and content development, staff upskilling/ capacity building and improved, coordinated industry engagement.</p>
        <p>10 The Crystal Associates team was appointed in January 2023 to lead on the industry consultation project, supporting nine colleges 6 in the Partnership with green skills provision. The main objective of this work has been to ensure the colleges and the Partnership are well placed to provide the skills and tools for local people to access the green jobs of the future. The scope of work has focused on the following career pathways, identified by the colleges through previous research and consultation: • Building Information Modelling • Computer Aided Design • Electric Vehicle Charging Installation • Ground source heat pumps • Internal/external insulation technologies • Photovoltaics • Smart/sustainable infrastructure • Restoring and sustaining London’s Green Spaces • Retrofitting Over the course of the project, we have focused on the following four areas, through a combination of desk research, extensive industry and wider stakeholder consultation, and direct engagement with each of the colleges: • Facilities - we have conducted dedicated site visits with each college, including meetings with the strategic leads and other key staff • Curriculum - we have reviewed and assessed both the current curriculum provision as well as planned provision tailored to the new pathways • Staff skills and training - we have undertaken a combination of staff focus groups, 1:1 meetings and an anonymous staff survey, alongside dedicated research and stakeholder engagement to obtain both quantitative and qualitative data on current and future market requirements and training • Industry engagement - we have undertaken extensive industry consultation, speaking to more than 100 organisations (from employers and industry associations to training and awarding bodies), as well as assessing the current levels of engagement at each college. In conclusion of this project, we have provided an overall summary report for the Partnership, alongside dedicated reports for each individual college. In this summary report, we focus on our assessment of and future opportunities for the Partnership and the Local London region as a whole, as it pertains to facilities, curriculum (current and planned), staff skills and training, and industry engagement. We share our findings and set out recommendations on facilities, future skills provision, staff training and collaboration with industry, against the overall objective of positioning the Local London area as a centre of excellence for several green skills pathways, including built environment/retrofit (incorporating key technologies such as digital, electric vehicle charging and green space). 3. OVERVIEW OF OUR METHODOLOGY AND APPROACH 6 Barnet and Southgate College, Barking &amp; Dagenham College, Capel Manor College, London South East Colleges, New City College, Newham College, Newham Sixth Form College, Shooters Hill Sixth Form College and Waltham Forest College.</p>
        <p>11 Key findings in each of the four themes of facilities, curriculum, staff skills and training, and industry engagement across the colleges in the Partnership are as follows: 4.1	College facilities Site visits were carried out to ten sites across the nine colleges. These were as follows: • Barking &amp; Dagenham College, Rush Green campus with the East London Institute of Technology • Barnet and Southgate College, Southgate campus • Capel Manor College, Enfield campus • London South East Colleges (LSEC), Bromley Campus • New City College, Hackney campus • Newham College, the London City Institute of Technology and Stratford campus • Newham Sixth Form College • Shooters Hill Sixth Form College • Waltham Forest College, Waltham Forest campus The majority of site visits took place between 27 January and 14 February before a lot of the equipment had started to be installed. Hence our findings are based on what was available to see and design drawings and floor plans. Four of the colleges received SDF funding for capital works expenditure: Barnet and Southgate, LSEC, Newham and Shooters Hill Sixth Form. 7 Eight of the colleges received capital equipment funding and six of them are working with Quantum Group to deliver and install the physical equipment required to deliver the new green skills-oriented curriculum. The following section summarises the facilities at each college which have been identified to provide the respective green skills courses. It also touches on any planned facility upgrades as part of the current SDF funding, and any perceived challenges and opportunities for the future. More details can be found in the individual college reports. 4.1.1	Barking &amp; Dagenham College The green provision will be located in an annex to the East London Institute of Technology (IoT). One of 12 current IoTs in the country it has been designed in partnership with Coventry University London, to deliver advanced and higherlevel specialist training in emerging occupations including construction and infrastructure technologies as well as advanced engineering and robotics, creative, digital and IT. Barking &amp; Dagenham College (BDC) is one of six colleges working with Quantum Group to deliver and install the physical equipment required to deliver the new green skills-oriented curriculum. The BDC project is being overseen by the Head of Department for Building Services and Smart Construction who carried out a similar project at Havering College. At the time of our site visit on 2 February 2023, the room had been prepared but no equipment had been installed. Capital equipment purchased by BDC as part of the SDF project is: smart home technology, a solar system, PV battery storage, four insulation testing rigs and EV testing rigs. During the site visit we were shown where the solar panels are to be installed on an adjoining roof. We were also informed there would be an air source heat pump located outside although it seemed not to have been purchased. 4. KEY FINDINGS 7 Newham College, Shooters Hill Sixth Form College and Waltham Forest College.</p>
        <p>12 4.1.2	Barnet and Southgate College We visited the Southgate Campus on 30 January 2023 and saw the proposed W21 (EV and PV workshop) and W25 (engineering workshop), two sections of currently one large room. We also visited a classroom for electrical teaching that had been recently refurbished. According to the Local London SDF application, Barnet and Southgate has 430m2 of space, which is the largest of the colleges. Barnet and Southgate is one of four colleges who bid for capital works expenditure as part of the SDF project. The laser cutter and two 3D printers were already in place. The seven booths shown in the design drawings for fault finding, student installation, service and maintenance, and working system were in the early stages of assembly. Other capital equipment purchased as part of the SDF project is EV equipment, PV equipment, as well as BIM licenses. There are also plans to upgrade the wider Southgate campus, in particular the heating systems currently under the canteen area. At the Colindale Campus in Barnet there are air source heat pumps but these are out of scope for this SDF project, due to the location of the campus outside of Local London. 4.1.3	Capel Manor College We visited the main Capel Manor and Garden site in Enfield on 6 February 2023. Capel Manor is the only landbased college within the Partnership. They did not receive any capital funding through the Local London SDF bid. Capel Manor currently has four other sites: Forty Hall Farm, Mottingham, Regents Park and Crystal Palace. All sites cover all five of Capel Manor’s curriculum areas. The Enfield site covers 30 acres. As well as the opportunity to focus on and demonstrate urban greening solutions such as rainwater harvesting, green walls and green roofs, Capel Manor has a lot of space for technology e.g. ground source heat pumps. There is also scope for Capel Manor to decarbonise its own buildings, such as the Vendo building which is said to be 80% ready and could be upgraded for rainwater run-off and storage and an existing network to showcase sustainable resourcing. 4.1.4	London South East Colleges (LSEC) We visited London South East Colleges’ Bromley campus on 14 February 2023. London South East Colleges (LSEC) is the lead partner in the Partnership. LSEC is a large further education college, with eight campuses across south east London providing a wide range of vocational and higher education courses. The LSEC campuses are located in three of the Local London boroughs: Bromley (Orpington campus), Bexley (Holly Hill and Bexley campuses) and Greenwich (Adult &amp; Community Learning Centre at Greenwich Park Centre, Construction Skills campus in Kidbrooke and Plumstead campus). LSEC is one of four colleges who bid for capital works expenditure as part of the SDF Application. LSEC is also one of the six colleges working with Quantum Group to deliver and install the equipment required. In line with the SDF application, LSEC plans a refurbishment and the electrification of existing space to provide a dedicated workshop of 300 m2 to accommodate the following equipment: working, student install and fault-finding air source heat pumps, solar PV, solar thermal and battery storage equipment, EV charging point systems, and 20 laptops and EV charging point systems as well as 20 laptops. At the time of the visit the equipment was still to be installed. In future the College also wants to develop a ‘smart home’, subject to further funding. Space is an issue around the site, making it necessary to move learners around different campuses. The Plumstead campus in the Royal Borough of Greenwich is currently being developed and could play a role in the future green and digital skills provision. 4.1.5	New City College We visited New City College on 3 March 2023 although we went to the Hackney campus (located outside the Local London boundaries) rather than the Rainham campus in order to see their completed green lab. New City College (NCC) consists of 11 campuses, six of which are located within the Local London region. Three are in the London Borough of Havering (Ardleigh Green Campus, Havering Sixth Form Campus and Rainham Construction &amp; Engineering) and three in the London Borough of Redbridge (Epping Forest &amp; Redbridge Campus, Ilford Campus and Redbridge Campus). The other five NCC sites are in Hackney (Hackney campus), Tower Hamlets (Arbour Square Campus &amp; Atlee A Level Academy and Tower Hamlets Campus) and further afield at the Westbourne Academy in Bournemouth and the Oxford School of English. Workshops and installation bays were showcased at the Hackney campus, as the first ones in the college group to be supplied and installed by Quantum Group. The finished bays provide practical spaces for learning, installing and maintaining heat pumps, electric vehicles, PV, solar thermal and battery storage. Quantum Group is also supplying and installing the same equipment at the Rainham Construction &amp; Engineering site and NCC has purchased two panels and DC battery storage, an air source heat pump system, EV charging points, a garage service kit and a demonstration vehicle.</p>
        <p>13 4.1.6	Newham College We visited Newham College’s Stratford campus on 27 January 2023 and the London City Institute of Technology on 9 February and again on 23 February 2023. We have covered the two sites separately. 4.1.6.1 Stratford campus Newham is one of four colleges who bid for capital funding as part of the SDF application. It is also one of the six colleges working with Quantum Group to deliver and install the equipment required. This is focused on the Stratford campus and the refurbishment of 360m2 of existing space, called W Block, to provide dedicated workshop space asa green technology facility for electric vehicles and new energy. Quantum Group is supplying and installing a full working solar PV system on the roof, EV charging points, air source heat pumps, solar thermal systems, PV panels, specialist tools and materials, and metaverse training resources. In addition, according to the SDF application, Newham College has also purchased IT hardware. As a result of a connection facilitated by Crystal Associates during the course of our consultation project, Newham College is planning to install 300 smart sockets in W Block supplied by Measurable Energy, which should support significant energy and carbon savings. 4.1.6.2	London City Institute of Technology The London City Institute of Technology (IoT) is a partnership between Newham College and Queen Mary University of London which has been open since September 2022. The IoT is comprised of eight floors shared with Queen Mary University, delivering high-quality technical qualifications in a range of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) subjects including engineering, digital and construction. Newham College uses the first five floors which include two set aside for businesses to occupy. The other floors consist of small classrooms – some set up as workshops, others as traditional classrooms, albeit with camera technology to allow for interactive hybrid learning. The eighth floor is used by Level 7 and 8 students on Mondays and Tuesdays. The rest of the week it is available to host events. During the course of this project the Crystal Associates team organised two events at the IoT: a roundtable on electric vehicles, chaired by the Clean Energy Cities lead at the Centre for Net Zero (part of Octopus Energy), and the Tech London Advocates PropTech Net Zero Challenge awards. 4.1.7	Newham Sixth Form College (NewVIc) We visited Newham Sixth Form College (NewVIc) on 3 February 2023. NewVIc’s main focus will be on the delivery of computer aided design (CAD) and building information modelling (BIM) courses. Therefore, 23 workstations were due to be bought as part of the SDF application. During the visit, we passed through the current classrooms and a new classroom which has been set up in a refurbished block in order to deliver the CAD training. 4.1.8 Shooters Hill Sixth Form College We visited Shooters Hill Sixth Form College on 30 January 2023. Shooters Hill is one of four colleges which bid for capital funding as part of the SDF application. This covers enclosure and bunding for the electric vehicle yard, estimated to be 35 m2 which was about to start at the time of the visit. The campus currently provides four bays for internal combustion engine vehicles. Shooters Hill is also one of the colleges working with Quantum Group to deliver and install the equipment required. In order to deliver the EV courses, Shooters Hill has purchased an EV charging point and a demonstration vehicle, which will be either full electric, a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) or hybrid. The equipment is relatively low voltage due to safety considerations, however the team would like to be able to offer training on higher voltage charging points for larger vehicles such as HGVs and buses in the future. Post our site visit we learnt that the charging unit has been installed, however it is smaller than anticipated and thus its effectiveness for teaching is uncertain. During the visit we also met with the Estates Director, who informed us Shooters Hill is also planning a wider redevelopment of the grounds. GREEN ACADEMIES PARTNERSHIP INDUSTRY CONSULTATION - A SUMMARY REPORT</p>
        <p>14 4.1.9	Waltham Forest College We visited Waltham Forest College on 2 February 2023. We walked through a number of workshop areas which were being being reconfigured to allow for the provision of green skills training. The College has an impressive motor vehicle area which looks like a professional garage. There is currently one bay for EVs, however this may not be sufficient. The College is also creating a smart home area. Bricklaying students have built the ‘home’ and it is currently being kitted out with PV as well as an air source heat pump. There is scope to add other technologies such as solar shading window film and smart sockets. Capital equipment purchased by Waltham Forest to be installed in the smart home includes air source heat pump systems and solar PV and battery storage systems (working, student install and fault finding). 4.2	Curriculum This section provides an overview of the current and planned provision for the nine career pathways, followed by a pathway by pathway overview of market trends and qualifications, with recommendations on opportunities for improvement, including: • Possible collaborations in the development of the curriculum and content • The potential for sharing specialist teaching and learning resources • Ways to reduce duplication and optimise value for money across the Partnership. Given the timing of the SDF funding, colleges have already settled on their respective pathways. Our consultation work has focused on identifying and evaluating the current curriculum being offered and the plans for the next academic year and beyond. We reviewed what colleges are planning to provide, assessing its relevance through an industry lens and identifying areas for collaboration with industry and across the colleges. The below table indicates what career pathways each college is currently delivering or plan to deliver in the next academic year and what pathways they are considering to offer in the future. 8. 8 As confirmed by the colleges during our site visits in January-March 2023.

        <p>GREEN ACADEMIES PARTNERSHIP INDUSTRY CONSULTATION - A SUMMARY REPORT 15 The pathways in order of popularity are: 1. Electric vehicle charging installation: seven colleges are delivering or plan to deliver courses in the next academic year. 2. Photovoltaics: six colleges are delivering or plan to deliver courses in the next academic year and one is considering it for the future. 3= Heat pumps (predominantly air source heat pumps): five colleges are delivering or plan to deliver courses in the next academic year and one college is considering it for the future. 3= Smart/sustainable infrastructure: five colleges are delivering or plan to deliver courses in the next academic year and one is considering it for the future. 5. Computer aided design: four colleges are delivering or plan to deliver courses in the next academic year and two are considering it for the future. 6. Building information modelling: three colleges are delivering or plan to deliver courses in the next academic year and one is considering it for the future. 7. Retrofit: one college is delivering or planning to deliver courses in the next academic year and two are considering it for the future. 8. Internal/external insulation technologies: two colleges will be considering it in the future. 9. Green Spaces: there is only one college with an obvious alignment with the green spaces career pathway, which is Capel Manor, however other colleges should keep the pathway in mind due to its broader relevance within planning and urban development. The career pathway choices are mostly based on/influenced by a combination of different factors, including: • The existing curriculum and qualifications offered by the colleges, combined with facilities, staff availability and staff experience. Therefore, colleges offering trades such as electrical, mechanical engineering, heating engineering, plumbing and construction, are considering green technologies such as photovoltaics, electric vehicle charging and heat pumps. • Previous decisions taken about capital funding and allocation on the upgrading of college facilities and infrastructure. • Awareness of the local policy framework, e.g. London’s focus on clean air and electric vehicle charging infrastructure. • A lack of in-depth awareness and insight in green career pathways in the FE education sector, such as: o	Retrofit - there is a lack of understanding and consideration of roles that are critical and the qualifications/ routes into retrofit careers, including Retrofit Advisors, Coordinators, Assessors, Designers, Installers and Evaluators. o	Insulation technology - this is one of the core components of retrofit and there is a need to ensure qualifications meet the occupational standards and alignment to PAS2035. o	Air source heat pumps (ASHP) – there is a growing nationwide need for ASHP installation, particularly in London, where space is limited for ground source heat pumps. The colleges are recognising this and are starting to send lecturers on ASHP courses. o	Alignment between different green technologies – creating a need for college departments to work together, for example automotive and electrical (for EV and EV charging), technology and construction (for smart building and energy efficiency), the trades (for green technologies and retrofit). • A lack of coordinated decision making within the Partnership leading to many of the colleges delivering the same pathway or qualifications.</p>
        <p>16 The qualifications offered by colleges vary depending on the type of college: • Most predominantly offer full-time courses for 16-19 years olds: Level 1, 2 and 3 qualifications and Level 3 apprenticeships in construction and the trades, e.g. bricklaying, carpentry, plumbing, electrical and construction multi skills. All of these subjects and qualifications are useful pathways into green careers in photovoltaics, electric vehicle charging installation, heat pumps, retrofitting and internal/ external insulation technologies. • Level 3 apprenticeships allow learners to specialise in year 4 in a green technology, e.g. a Level 3 qualification in plumbing or conventional heating engineering, with a specialisation in ground source heat pumps. This ensures laying down the foundational learning and industry prerequisites before choosing a green pathway. • Several of the colleges are planning to offer or are already offering the new T-levels. The T-Levels are intended to be an alternative to A-levels, apprenticeships and other courses for 16-19 year olds. They are currently in an early stage of development and the available construction related T-Levels are primarily focussed on new build. However, they offer a good opportunity for the green career pathways, in particular if the work placement is able to offer the relevant experience. Some T-levels, such as the T-Level in Construction Design, Surveying and Planning, give learners the opportunity to develop highly desirable design skills, using tools like CAD. Other construction T-levels, such as T-level Technical Qualification in Onsite Construction, allow learners to develop more of the skills for installing, maintaining and fault finding of green technologies. • Several colleges are offering transition pathways at Level 2, which are a good way to introduce learners to different green pathways. These courses are designed to allow a learner to gain the level of mathematics and English they require and to try the vocational area, before considering whether to progress onto a T-Level, apprenticeship or other Level 2-3 qualification. • A smaller number of colleges offer short or part-time courses for adult learners who want to upskill. This is a very important aspect of the green careers pathways. Examples include upskilling in retrofit via PAS2035-aligned qualifications (for skilled workers in aligned trades, e.g. plastering, rendering) or Level 3 18th Edition: Award in the Requirements for Electrical Installation Award, for Photovoltaics (key for employers). A list of the qualifications offered by the nine colleges is included in Annex 1 of this report. The following section gives further details for each pathway. Our recommendations for career pathways and qualifications across the Partnership are based on: industry needs, Local London needs, recognising which colleges are best suited to deliver specific pathways, reviewing types and levels of qualification and which colleges are best placed to deliver them, coordinating and combining resources and staff training. 4.2.1 Computer Aided Design (CAD) and Building Information Modelling (BIM) Given the connected nature of these two career pathways we have looked at them together in this report. THE MARKET The global computer-aided design (CAD) market was valued at USD 9.89 billion in 2021 and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.9% up to 2030. 9 Key players in the 3D CAD software market that have been mentioned by some of the colleges and employers interviewed include Autodesk, Bentley Systems, Dassault Syst&#232;mes, Siemens, Trimble and TurboCAD. The global building information modelling (BIM) market was valued at USD 5.2 billion in 2019, and is projected to reach almost USD 16 billion by 202710. The generally understood objective of BIM software is to enhance project performance and to produce better outcomes through enhanced data communication and coordination among various stakeholders coupled with improved construction productivity. To this effect, BIM is sometimes also defined as “Better Information Management” and not just at construction stage but across the whole value chain from initial concept design, through to construction, operation, retrofit and even demolition. A key part of this is the concept of digital twins. The global digital twin market size was valued at USD 11.12 billion in 2022 and is projected to exhibit a CAGR of 37.5% from 2023 to 2030. 11 9 Polaris Market Research, 2022.
