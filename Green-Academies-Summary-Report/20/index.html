        <p>20 4.2.5 Photovoltaics THE MARKET The Mayor of London is committed to increasing the amount of solar energy captured in London as part of his wider ambition for London to become a zero-carbon city. The Mayor of London’s ‘Accelerated Green’ net zero pathway sets a target for at least 1.5 gigawatts (GW) of rooftop solar to be installed by 203022, exceeding his previous target of 1GW under the 2018 Mayor’s Solar Action Plan. Achieving this will require strong and supportive policy from national government alongside local government, private sector, charities, individuals and of course colleges. Through spatial mapping and access to technical support the London Solar Opportunity Map highlights opportunity areas for installing solar and battery storage in homes and businesses. A report commissioned by the Greater London Authority and published in April 2022 ‘Planning for Roof Mounted Solar Photovoltaics in London’ identified that almost one third of Greater London’s area consists of building rooftops, 530km2, however half of the existing residential building stock are flats with complex shared ownership and one fifth is designated as a Conservation Area. 23 Nevertheless, 15% of households or half a million homes are already in fuel poverty. Increasing installation rates of solar PV could not only provide energy savings but also help alleviate fuel poverty within the city, especially as energy prices have increased considerably since 2020. COLLEGE PROVISION Of the nine colleges, six plan to provide courses around photovoltaics in the short term. NewVIc would like to introduce photovoltaics at some time in the future, space permitting or in partnership with a college that already provides photovoltaics. Only Capel Manor and Shooters Hill do not not plan to provide courses around solar although Capel Manor may utilise solar panels on the homes in the show gardens. Of the seven colleges, four are also looking to include battery storage and solar thermal – these are LSEC, New City College, Newham College and Waltham Forest College. To support this transition, we have engaged with Solar Energy UK, an established trade association working for the solar industry, representing 256 businesses and associations. Solar Energy UK has a core set of recommended qualifications that we have considered and curated in the CPD, training and qualifications spreadsheet (see Annex 2). QUALIFICATIONS Colleges have several options to consider: • Providing a Level 2 Introduction to Photovoltaics – this can be included as part of a transition course or other foundational learning before choosing Level 3 progression routes or alternative pathways. Quantum Group has created a Level 2 qualification which is a good introduction to Photovoltaics: Level 2 ‘Sustainable Energy and Renewables Technologies’ course. This qualification covers installation, service, maintenance, commissioning and fault finding. It also covers wider aspects of understanding the climate challenge, energy transition and the commercial skills required for the workplace. Quantum Group offers a license model for colleges and train the trainer training, teaching and assessment resources. • Providing an environmental specialism in Year 4 of Level 3 courses, such as trade based electrical apprenticeships, or as a bolt-on or progression route. For example, City &amp; Guilds offers qualifications in ‘Installation, Service and Maintenance of Environmental Technology Systems’ and an appropriate selection for the following awards: o Level 3 Award in Environmental Technologies o Level 3 Award in the Installation of Small Scale Solar Photovoltaic Systems o Level 3 Award in the Installation and Maintenance of Small Scale Solar Photovoltaic Systems o Level 3 Award in the Installation of Solar Thermal Hot Water Systems o Level 3 Award in the Installation and Maintenance of Solar Thermal Hot Water Systems All learners will need at least a NVQ 3 in Electrical Installation (Buildings and Structures) or equivalent earlier certification that provides evidence of competence. In addition, if not included, they will need current certification of BS 7671 Requirements for Electrical Installations – this can be provided by offering the City &amp; Guilds Level 3 18th Edition: Award in the Requirements for Electrical Installation Award. 22 Greater London Authority, 2022.
