        <p>13 4.1.6	Newham College We visited Newham College’s Stratford campus on 27 January 2023 and the London City Institute of Technology on 9 February and again on 23 February 2023. We have covered the two sites separately. 4.1.6.1 Stratford campus Newham is one of four colleges who bid for capital funding as part of the SDF application. It is also one of the six colleges working with Quantum Group to deliver and install the equipment required. This is focused on the Stratford campus and the refurbishment of 360m2 of existing space, called W Block, to provide dedicated workshop space asa green technology facility for electric vehicles and new energy. Quantum Group is supplying and installing a full working solar PV system on the roof, EV charging points, air source heat pumps, solar thermal systems, PV panels, specialist tools and materials, and metaverse training resources. In addition, according to the SDF application, Newham College has also purchased IT hardware. As a result of a connection facilitated by Crystal Associates during the course of our consultation project, Newham College is planning to install 300 smart sockets in W Block supplied by Measurable Energy, which should support significant energy and carbon savings. 4.1.6.2	London City Institute of Technology The London City Institute of Technology (IoT) is a partnership between Newham College and Queen Mary University of London which has been open since September 2022. The IoT is comprised of eight floors shared with Queen Mary University, delivering high-quality technical qualifications in a range of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) subjects including engineering, digital and construction. Newham College uses the first five floors which include two set aside for businesses to occupy. The other floors consist of small classrooms – some set up as workshops, others as traditional classrooms, albeit with camera technology to allow for interactive hybrid learning. The eighth floor is used by Level 7 and 8 students on Mondays and Tuesdays. The rest of the week it is available to host events. During the course of this project the Crystal Associates team organised two events at the IoT: a roundtable on electric vehicles, chaired by the Clean Energy Cities lead at the Centre for Net Zero (part of Octopus Energy), and the Tech London Advocates PropTech Net Zero Challenge awards. 4.1.7	Newham Sixth Form College (NewVIc) We visited Newham Sixth Form College (NewVIc) on 3 February 2023. NewVIc’s main focus will be on the delivery of computer aided design (CAD) and building information modelling (BIM) courses. Therefore, 23 workstations were due to be bought as part of the SDF application. During the visit, we passed through the current classrooms and a new classroom which has been set up in a refurbished block in order to deliver the CAD training. 4.1.8 Shooters Hill Sixth Form College We visited Shooters Hill Sixth Form College on 30 January 2023. Shooters Hill is one of four colleges which bid for capital funding as part of the SDF application. This covers enclosure and bunding for the electric vehicle yard, estimated to be 35 m2 which was about to start at the time of the visit. The campus currently provides four bays for internal combustion engine vehicles. Shooters Hill is also one of the colleges working with Quantum Group to deliver and install the equipment required. In order to deliver the EV courses, Shooters Hill has purchased an EV charging point and a demonstration vehicle, which will be either full electric, a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) or hybrid. The equipment is relatively low voltage due to safety considerations, however the team would like to be able to offer training on higher voltage charging points for larger vehicles such as HGVs and buses in the future. Post our site visit we learnt that the charging unit has been installed, however it is smaller than anticipated and thus its effectiveness for teaching is uncertain. During the visit we also met with the Estates Director, who informed us Shooters Hill is also planning a wider redevelopment of the grounds.
