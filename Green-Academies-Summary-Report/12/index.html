        <h1>Green Academies Summary Report</h1>
        <p>12 4.1.2	Barnet and Southgate College We visited the Southgate Campus on 30 January 2023 and saw the proposed W21 (EV and PV workshop) and W25 (engineering workshop), two sections of currently one large room. We also visited a classroom for electrical teaching that had been recently refurbished. According to the Local London SDF application, Barnet and Southgate has 430m2 of space, which is the largest of the colleges. Barnet and Southgate is one of four colleges who bid for capital works expenditure as part of the SDF project. The laser cutter and two 3D printers were already in place. The seven booths shown in the design drawings for fault finding, student installation, service and maintenance, and working system were in the early stages of assembly. Other capital equipment purchased as part of the SDF project is EV equipment, PV equipment, as well as BIM licenses. There are also plans to upgrade the wider Southgate campus, in particular the heating systems currently under the canteen area. At the Colindale Campus in Barnet there are air source heat pumps but these are out of scope for this SDF project, due to the location of the campus outside of Local London. 4.1.3	Capel Manor College We visited the main Capel Manor and Garden site in Enfield on 6 February 2023. Capel Manor is the only landbased college within the Partnership. They did not receive any capital funding through the Local London SDF bid. Capel Manor currently has four other sites: Forty Hall Farm, Mottingham, Regents Park and Crystal Palace. All sites cover all five of Capel Manor’s curriculum areas. The Enfield site covers 30 acres. As well as the opportunity to focus on and demonstrate urban greening solutions such as rainwater harvesting, green walls and green roofs, Capel Manor has a lot of space for technology e.g. ground source heat pumps. There is also scope for Capel Manor to decarbonise its own buildings, such as the Vendo building which is said to be 80% ready and could be upgraded for rainwater run-off and storage and an existing network to showcase sustainable resourcing. 4.1.4	London South East Colleges (LSEC) We visited London South East Colleges’ Bromley campus on 14 February 2023. London South East Colleges (LSEC) is the lead partner in the Partnership. LSEC is a large further education college, with eight campuses across south east London providing a wide range of vocational and higher education courses. The LSEC campuses are located in three of the Local London boroughs: Bromley (Orpington campus), Bexley (Holly Hill and Bexley campuses) and Greenwich (Adult &amp; Community Learning Centre at Greenwich Park Centre, Construction Skills campus in Kidbrooke and Plumstead campus). LSEC is one of four colleges who bid for capital works expenditure as part of the SDF Application. LSEC is also one of the six colleges working with Quantum Group to deliver and install the equipment required. In line with the SDF application, LSEC plans a refurbishment and the electrification of existing space to provide a dedicated workshop of 300 m2 to accommodate the following equipment: working, student install and fault-finding air source heat pumps, solar PV, solar thermal and battery storage equipment, EV charging point systems, and 20 laptops and EV charging point systems as well as 20 laptops. At the time of the visit the equipment was still to be installed. In future the College also wants to develop a ‘smart home’, subject to further funding. Space is an issue around the site, making it necessary to move learners around different campuses. The Plumstead campus in the Royal Borough of Greenwich is currently being developed and could play a role in the future green and digital skills provision. 4.1.5	New City College We visited New City College on 3 March 2023 although we went to the Hackney campus (located outside the Local London boundaries) rather than the Rainham campus in order to see their completed green lab. New City College (NCC) consists of 11 campuses, six of which are located within the Local London region. Three are in the London Borough of Havering (Ardleigh Green Campus, Havering Sixth Form Campus and Rainham Construction &amp; Engineering) and three in the London Borough of Redbridge (Epping Forest &amp; Redbridge Campus, Ilford Campus and Redbridge Campus). The other five NCC sites are in Hackney (Hackney campus), Tower Hamlets (Arbour Square Campus &amp; Atlee A Level Academy and Tower Hamlets Campus) and further afield at the Westbourne Academy in Bournemouth and the Oxford School of English. Workshops and installation bays were showcased at the Hackney campus, as the first ones in the college group to be supplied and installed by Quantum Group. The finished bays provide practical spaces for learning, installing and maintaining heat pumps, electric vehicles, PV, solar thermal and battery storage. Quantum Group is also supplying and installing the same equipment at the Rainham Construction &amp; Engineering site and NCC has purchased two panels and DC battery storage, an air source heat pump system, EV charging points, a garage service kit and a demonstration vehicle.</p>
