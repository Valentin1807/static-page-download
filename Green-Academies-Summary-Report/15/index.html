        <p>GREEN ACADEMIES PARTNERSHIP INDUSTRY CONSULTATION - A SUMMARY REPORT 15 The pathways in order of popularity are: 1. Electric vehicle charging installation: seven colleges are delivering or plan to deliver courses in the next academic year. 2. Photovoltaics: six colleges are delivering or plan to deliver courses in the next academic year and one is considering it for the future. 3= Heat pumps (predominantly air source heat pumps): five colleges are delivering or plan to deliver courses in the next academic year and one college is considering it for the future. 3= Smart/sustainable infrastructure: five colleges are delivering or plan to deliver courses in the next academic year and one is considering it for the future. 5. Computer aided design: four colleges are delivering or plan to deliver courses in the next academic year and two are considering it for the future. 6. Building information modelling: three colleges are delivering or plan to deliver courses in the next academic year and one is considering it for the future. 7. Retrofit: one college is delivering or planning to deliver courses in the next academic year and two are considering it for the future. 8. Internal/external insulation technologies: two colleges will be considering it in the future. 9. Green Spaces: there is only one college with an obvious alignment with the green spaces career pathway, which is Capel Manor, however other colleges should keep the pathway in mind due to its broader relevance within planning and urban development. The career pathway choices are mostly based on/influenced by a combination of different factors, including: • The existing curriculum and qualifications offered by the colleges, combined with facilities, staff availability and staff experience. Therefore, colleges offering trades such as electrical, mechanical engineering, heating engineering, plumbing and construction, are considering green technologies such as photovoltaics, electric vehicle charging and heat pumps. • Previous decisions taken about capital funding and allocation on the upgrading of college facilities and infrastructure. • Awareness of the local policy framework, e.g. London’s focus on clean air and electric vehicle charging infrastructure. • A lack of in-depth awareness and insight in green career pathways in the FE education sector, such as: o	Retrofit - there is a lack of understanding and consideration of roles that are critical and the qualifications/ routes into retrofit careers, including Retrofit Advisors, Coordinators, Assessors, Designers, Installers and Evaluators. o	Insulation technology - this is one of the core components of retrofit and there is a need to ensure qualifications meet the occupational standards and alignment to PAS2035. o	Air source heat pumps (ASHP) – there is a growing nationwide need for ASHP installation, particularly in London, where space is limited for ground source heat pumps. The colleges are recognising this and are starting to send lecturers on ASHP courses. o	Alignment between different green technologies – creating a need for college departments to work together, for example automotive and electrical (for EV and EV charging), technology and construction (for smart building and energy efficiency), the trades (for green technologies and retrofit). • A lack of coordinated decision making within the Partnership leading to many of the colleges delivering the same pathway or qualifications.</p>
