        <p>14 4.1.9	Waltham Forest College We visited Waltham Forest College on 2 February 2023. We walked through a number of workshop areas which were being being reconfigured to allow for the provision of green skills training. The College has an impressive motor vehicle area which looks like a professional garage. There is currently one bay for EVs, however this may not be sufficient. The College is also creating a smart home area. Bricklaying students have built the ‘home’ and it is currently being kitted out with PV as well as an air source heat pump. There is scope to add other technologies such as solar shading window film and smart sockets. Capital equipment purchased by Waltham Forest to be installed in the smart home includes air source heat pump systems and solar PV and battery storage systems (working, student install and fault finding). 4.2	Curriculum This section provides an overview of the current and planned provision for the nine career pathways, followed by a pathway by pathway overview of market trends and qualifications, with recommendations on opportunities for improvement, including: • Possible collaborations in the development of the curriculum and content • The potential for sharing specialist teaching and learning resources • Ways to reduce duplication and optimise value for money across the Partnership. Given the timing of the SDF funding, colleges have already settled on their respective pathways. Our consultation work has focused on identifying and evaluating the current curriculum being offered and the plans for the next academic year and beyond. We reviewed what colleges are planning to provide, assessing its relevance through an industry lens and identifying areas for collaboration with industry and across the colleges. The below table indicates what career pathways each college is currently delivering or plan to deliver in the next academic year and what pathways they are considering to offer in the future. 8. 8 As confirmed by the colleges during our site visits in January-March 2023.
