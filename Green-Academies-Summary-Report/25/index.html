        <p>25 GREEN ACADEMIES PARTNERSHIP INDUSTRY CONSULTATION - A SUMMARY REPORT • There are specific chall enges for the new T-Levels. For more trade-based colleges, the design and technical element of the T-level Construction: Design, Surveying and Planning can be more challenging to deliver, as it requires a higher level of maths and English, alongside design experience. Those colleges often do not have the learner profile, the staff experience or the facilities to deliver this. When reviewing confidence levels (drawn from the survey responses 36), our findings are as follows: Common themes: • Most respondents (70%) did not feel confident teaching higher level apprenticeships. • Most respondents (74%) felt they needed more support to build wider subject knowledge and be able to deliver the qualification at all levels. • Most respondents (64%) felt they needed more support developing technical (hands-on) experience. Stark differences between some of the green career pathways/colleges: • EV charging installation: respondents were most ready to deliver the green pathways. They felt confident teaching the learning outcomes required and clear on how to plan and set assessments. However, those that had not had hands-on experience and training wanted to have this before they began teaching. • Heat pumps: respondents returned lower levels of confidence compared to other pathways. Only one respondent (25%) agreed with the statements “I know how to assess a learner in ground source heat pumps” and “I can plan and set learner assessments for ground source heat pumps”. When rating their confidence teaching the four key learning outcomes, three responded “partially confident” and one had “zero confidence”. This may be partly due to the potential change to air source heat pumps and because staff are in the process of planning the CPD they require. The staff are also aware that there are wider considerations within a new build or retrofit installation, including the assessment of needs, design and other installation considerations which differ from a standard installation. • CAD and BIM: respondents teaching CAD at NewVIc reported high levels of confidence in planning and setting learning assessments and teaching a wide range of course levels. This is mainly because there is a staff member that is competent with CAD and is willing to support other staff. There is also a commitment from the department lead to support staff to develop both CAD and BIM skills. • Modular qualifications/short credentialled courses: very few respondents felt confident teaching these courses to support green career pathways, mainly because they are used as bolt-ons and staff did not yet feel confident to deliver these subject areas. Where the bolt-on is a technical skill like BIM, they require the specific CPD course to upskill. • Green spaces: Capel Manor had the widest range of confidence. This is likely due to the fact that they are a land-based college offering a very different range of qualifications to the rest of the colleges. 36 Respondents were asked to rate their confidence teaching a green career pathway. This included setting tasks and assessing learners, teaching installation, maintenance and troubleshooting and teaching different course types. Respondents were also asked in which areas they felt they needed more support and training.</p>
